/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<p>Are reviewers motivated to post a review by negative experiences or positive ones?</p>
<p>I always assumed the majority of reviews come from frustrated customers seeking justice. Perhaps this is more of a reflection of my personal biases than the actual truth. So I looked through the Yelp reviews of restaurants local to Blacksburg to determine whether passionate reviews were more often positive or negative.</p>
<p>Positivity was defined using the Positive-Negative word count differences out of a positive and negative text dictionary. The difference was used instead of the ratio so that truly neutral reviews would start at 0, not 1.</p>

<pre>&#39;The tortilla chips were good the salsa was really good I ordered the Guacamole Salmon Salad and it was so good I almost ate the plate that came with it The salmon was cooked flawlessly not overcooked and dry like most places and the veggies were very fresh! The dressing was amazing!Shout out to Lindsay for the awesome service! Thank you This place makes me wish I was a local in this town Definitely a gem! I\&#39;m coming here again!! Nice variety of appetizers and entree\&#39;sWell staffed swift service and cozy atmosphere are main impressions Food was good and put in a medium price rangeThis restaurant is a good one to visit when enjoying Blacksburg It serves as a good alternative to and a regular franchise restaurants or fast food restaurantsEnjoy! Living in Blacksburg for the past 3 years I\&#39;ve heard a lot of goods things about Cabo fish taco When people visit tech whether for football games or family weekend a lot of them people go here Cabo has this neat deal on Tuesday where you can get $3 tacos for certain tacos I generally work in the evening on Tuesday\&#39;s but I had a Tuesday off so I made sure I went to try this place I ordered 4 tacos (2 white fish taco 1 chicken taco 1 salmon taco) and a huge margarita (el toro)! At Cabo they also give you free chips and salsa which is nice to munch on as you wait for your foodThe el toro was huge and also very good The tacos were spectacular! You wouldn\&#39;t think to go to a fish place in the middle of the mountains however the fish tacos at Cabo were really good! My favorite was the white fish tacosOverall this place is really good especially if you go on Tuesday for their deal! Next time when my friends and I don\&#39;t have work on Tuesday we will be sure to stop by This is easily my favorite restaurant in Blacksburg and was a staple of my 4 years at Virginia Tech Great atmosphere especially outdoors in the warm months Close to the bars downtown as well On this visit I started with the Cabo Roll and got the chicken quesadilla with peppers and pineapple for my entree The wrap was delicious- crab is one of my favorite foods and this did not disappoint; It was light and flavorful The quesadilla here is one of my all time favorite foods There are so many different menu items I want to get but always end up going with the same thing every time because it is THAT good The pineapple just makes it special I\&#39;ve tried to recreate it at home but it just doesn\&#39;t compare I will always come here when I visit Blacksburg and I will always recommend it to anyone in the area Potentially my favorite restaurant of all time! TACOS! there is A good reason &#34;taco&#34; is in the name of the restaurant! The tortillas for the tacos are exceptional and that does make a difference The queso was so delicious we ordered two bowls Trio of salsas gets a big thumbs up especially the salsa verde 9 pm arrival after the Hokies loss to BC 5 of us Asked bartender Amy to make us a Casa Noble margarita &#34;spicy&#34; and she delivered! Even checked back with us to make sure we liked it! Alexis was our server &amp; she did an outstanding job navigating us through the menu since it was our first time Lots of great beers on tap and especially glad to see Modelo Negra on tap too Bartender &amp; manager Bubba never stopped moving! Even had time to let me taste the Ballast Point Sour Wench Super spot Look forward to returning especially when we can enjoy the outdoor patio space The place seems a little overhyped Ordered chicken and fish taco Food served was cold and smelled uncooked Lucky I didn\&#39;t fall ill Taste wasn\&#39;t great either The complimentary chips and salsa are good though I\&#39;ve lived in Blacksburg for close to 3 years now and I hate to say but there\&#39;s only a handful of really good restaurants Cabo fish taco is one of them Personally I love fish tacos especially the ones they serve on campus (Grilfield truck) I like going to Cabo when it\&#39;s semi busy because you can really enjoy the ambiance and conversation with whoever your with (especially if you\&#39;re outside) My sister and I started with drinks fried calamari queso to go with the chips The fried calamari is excellent!!! It was light and it melted in your mouth I\&#39;ve been to places where they\&#39;ve overcooked the calamari and it\&#39;s super rubbery and gross But here it was perfect However the queso was like a goopy mess I didn\&#39;t like the kind of cheese the used and it was entirely too thick Funny thing is as I continued to eat it the more I enjoyed The complementary chips and corn salsa was so good Since I loved the calamari so much I got the bangin Baja tacos with calamari with rice and beans What surprised me was how consistently good the calamari was The only problem was the guacamole it has a weird artificial taste Other than that if you love calamari as much as me you should definitely try this out The drinks were pretty good They have a pretty decent size drink selection which is awesome because alcohol and tacos go hand in hand A completely different taco dimension I thought I\&#39;ve had tacos in every possible way one can think of I was wrongI tried three different tacos and my daughter tried one Blacked Salmon - a lot of delicious flavors going on and salmon was cooked perfectly &amp; melted in my mouth! Tofu Chili - I was torn between this and blackened salmon being my fav Loved the deep fried tofu! My fave and have been trying to replicate at home since I tried it here at Cabo Fish Taco! Baja Shrimp - a lot more flavor than the beer bartered It\&#39;s basically the beer battered w/ Baja sauce Both versions were plump juicy prawns!! Beer Battered - batter was crisp &amp; shrimp was thick &amp; juicy! So delicious!!!! Entire experience was perfect Staff was awesome and bathrooms clean If I lived in the area this spot would definitely be my go-to! It\&#39;s amazing how much has changed in Blacksburg since I was a student there and how some things have not changed much at all Cabo is still there on Main Street with only slight menu updates and the same decent food as always The chips with lime are great but not a huge fan of the corn salsa The chicken tacos were ok as usual- never as spicy as I would like but better than a lot of other places Service was friendly and fast It\&#39;s pretty much an old stand by for the town Loved the complementary chips and corn salsa! I ordered the steak taco and the special taco of the day which was what I believe was carnitas (you can mix and match) and the special was definitely the winner Food looked good around the table- no one in my party eats seafood but they all enjoyed what they ordered We also tried the artichoke dip and the unique chips that came with it really made it shine Will be sure to return if I\&#39;m ever in the Blacksburg area again! The chips and shrimp were good but the blackened mahi-mahi was past its date and the guacamole was not home made The guac pasta was also not good and a strange combination I don\&#39;t think this place is as good as chipotle or any other chain Mexican place I come here every time I\&#39;m in Blacksburg! Too good to miss out on They have both upstairs seating as well as outside seatingYou get free house made chips and salsa but I always get the crab and shrimp dip it comes with toasted pita bread! Honestly I probably come back for this appetizer more than the tacos! It\&#39;s to die for!Ever since I got the Soy ginger shrimp tacos I haven\&#39;t been able to try anything else because it\&#39;s so satisfying! I either get the guacamole pasta or jalapeo mashers as a side! Both are good the tacos even better A normal meal usually gets you two tacos but you ask for two different tacos!Fun atmosphere with a fully stocked bar! Mmmmm so good!! Came in on a Wednesday night around 7- it wasn\&#39;t too busy but that made sense considering students were still on break I got the soy ginger shrimp tacos w jalapeo cheddar mashers as the side but seriously yummy!! The shrimp was cooked perfectly and felt plump crisp and juicy to the bite! We also got the salsa trio as an appetizer-- but honestly you don\&#39;t need it the chips and salsa they start you with is plenty enough If anything I think I would get a dip or something to try something different! The cheddar mash was so good but I couldn\&#39;t finish it cause I was so full after the chips and tacos!! Overall really nice place Would definitely go again when I come back to Blacksburg Cabo was a great place for lunchtime tacos We went during VT\&#39;s Spring Break so it wasn\&#39;t too busy; the wait staff was pleasant attentive and laughed at my stupid jokes (bless them)We started with guac and a variety of salsas (when you order guac they give you the whole flight of toppings including a tomato salsa onions etc) Those were very goodI had the grilled lemon shrimp tacos - they were fantastic with just a touch of heat to spice things up The shrimps were generous and the tacos were a good amount of food My husband had a BBQ taco which he also lovedAll in all well worth it for a nice lunch (and I\&#39;m sure a good dinner too) I\&#39;ve gone here more times than I can remember since 2009 (my freshman year at tech) and nine years later I will continue to say this is the best restaurant in Blacksburg I passionately believe a Virginia Tech visit is never complete without a bite at Cabo so when I took my cousins to Open House for prospective students this weekend I knew where to take them for dinner (Spoiler alert: they loved it too)Okay so the first thing I have to say because it made me incredibly sad--the BBQ Mahi Mahi tacos are GONE And I think they\&#39;re gone indefinitely according to my server :\&#39;( The only other issue I had was that the kitchen was really backed upat 4pmon a Saturday This was probably because of all the families in town for Open House I think we waited about 30 min+ for our food to come out The anticipation of going back here after 15 years of being deprived made the unusually longer wait for food even more unbearable The free chips and salsa are amazing but that alone wasn\&#39;t going to suffice I was getting to the point of hangry status But once the food came out it was still amazing I know this isn\&#39;t the norm so I\&#39;ll let it go!Anyways my go-to items are as followsApp: Crab and Shrimp dip This is a MUST There\&#39;s a good amount of crab and shrimp mixed in + the pita wedges are so perfectly soft and crispy Being cream based it can be a bit heavy so if you want to leave room for the amazing tacos you\&#39;ll want to share it with your tablemates (I mean that\&#39;s a given for apps right?)Entree: Get a taco The lightly fried flour tortilla sauces and fillings complement pretty much all of the tacos really well My favorites are the following:- soy ginger shrimp tacos (light and crispy breading with a BOMB sweet and savory sauce)- beer battered white fish (pretty standard and a good one to get if it\&#39;s your first time at Cabo)At my recent visit one of my cousins tried the soy ginger salmon (basically the same as the shrimp one but \&#39;healthier\&#39;) and said it was delicious Sides: - Jalapeo potato mashers (spicy but delicious)- Avocado pasta salad (creamy but not overwhelmingly creamy This is a new offering as of maybe 3 years ago?)- Baja rice (pretty refreshing)Don\&#39;t listen to those people (aka 5% of my hokie friends) who say this place is &#34;meh&#34; or &#34;just okay&#34; They don\&#39;t know what good food taste like ;) #CaboCultForever Wow! My son has lived in Blacksburg for the past 8 years and has raves that this is his favorite place to eat On a visit we stopped in on a Tuesday night and I can see why! Nothing but the freshest of ingredients!First who doesn\&#39;t love homemade salsa! This one has corn in it (nice touch) and the chips were warm with just a hint to salt We also started with the guacamole which was the only underwhelming dish we had The mix-ins (onions salsa jalapeos etc) were a nice touch to create your own Nice hint of lime juice as well I got the steak fajitas and they are not what you get from those run of the mill restaurants where it comes on a steaming platter of chewy over cooked meat This was so much better! Seasoned to perfection and tender it came with lots of fresh ingredients to make the perfect fajita! The kid had a chicken quesadilla no onions or peppers He loved it and it\&#39;s great that they will customize dishes adding or subtracting as you want it It proves they make everything fresh! My son of course loved his carne asada burrito He\&#39;s had most everything on the menu and his is one of his favorites The jalapeo mashed potatoes on the side were different and yummy! His fianc enjoyed the carne asada tacos with a side of refried beans (obviously fresh and not the out of a can slop in most Mexican places!) It was a gorgeous dish!Fast friendly service and affordable prices for those kinds of fresh dishes assure we will be back when in town again! The Main Street was closed for an art fair and there were literally thousands of people in the streets 7 o\&#39;clock on a Saturday and the place was lined up out the door 30 minutes wait but first come first served at the bar Boom wide open Must have just been good luck The menu is extensive and a lot of great stuff but we opted for tacos The server was awesome and the service was top notch They were rocking it We started with chips and 3 salsas also guacamole As you can see in the picture the 3 salsas are verde mango and habanero Surpringly the habanero was not the typical heat with no flavor The verde had the most satisfying taste and the mango added a delicious sweet punch up The guacamole came with fresh chopped onion and jalapeo to mix into the guacamole and also some pico de gallo Really delicious We both ordered tacos ala carte I had 3 of the best shrimp tacos I\&#39;ve ever tried Ginger + Soy Banging Baja and Garlic Buffalo They were all delicious The Buffalo was quite spicy and I liked it The place has a huge outdoor seating area too for nights like this when the weather was gorgeous I can see why the place is so popular Oh so delicious! Had the beer battered whitefish and honey salmon tacos with the refried beans Was hard to decide which tacos to choose as several good choices My first time here so I need to thank Nate for being patient and helping me to decide on which two Each taco was unique and had a generous portion of fish and veggies I will definitely be back next time in Blacksburg! Seriously this place deserves 6 stars The food was fantastic the service was even better The only thing I would say is maybe add more tables if possible But other than that I have no complaints one of the best restaurants ive been in a while You guys made it on my food page @jmufoodadventures FOLLOW! Had lunch here for the first time on a Friday with our son and his girlfriend Super cool vibe Seated right away Our server was Marcella who was attentive had a bright personality and gave great menu recommendations Food came out amazingly fastThe tavarua tuna tacos were some of the best fish tacos I\&#39;ve ever had My wife enjoyed the soy ginger shrimp tacosThe tortilla chips they served were better than you get at most Mexican restaurants and had just the right amount of salt for my taste The fresh guacamole was good but had a little too much lime juice for meWill definitely go back next time we\&#39;re in Blacksburg Best food in Blacksburg--hands down My go to\&#39;s are always the BBQ grouper tacos and the lemon shrimp tacos but you can\&#39;t go wrong with any of them The spinach artichoke dip is also to die for A must-try restaurant for anyone new to Blacksburg I LOVE CABO I went here dozens of times as an undergraduate and it\&#39;s one of my first stops every time I\&#39;m in town With the recent (I was told it was done 15 years ago so maybe just recent to visitors like me) remodel it looks fantastic They\&#39;ve done a great job keeping the spirit of the place while upgrading it wellWhen I went recently we waited for 30 minutes for a table while being able to drink in the old parking lot with the temporary bar set up So nice especially since they don\&#39;t have a waiting area to speak ofThe food is always solid at Cabo I got the BBQ maui maui tacos with jalapeno mashers and I was stuffed! Had a nice kick to it too The queso to start probably didn\&#39;t help but it was worth it Take a margarita to wash it down and you\&#39;re set to have a great night Probably I expected too much from the raved reviews Arrived extremely starving Wished chips and salsa were served as soon as I sat down or at least while I was thinking of menu like other Mexican restaurants Server served my first order a special soup but still didn\&#39;t bring me any chips So I reminded of him to bring me chips Maybe the server forgot about it? I was so hungry so his late delivery of chips made me somewhat impatient that time The soup of the day carrot and coconut milk soup tasted interesting Not bad but I was not too excited about it I dipped my chips into the soup Corn salsa which seemed to be raved by other reviews was more like a side-salad rather than dipping for the chips to my taste I would need to order other dipping sauces like artichoke dip next time Calamari was my favorite Crisp batter and very nice texture of calamari Sauces were not much different from other places but calamari tasted outstanding If there were no calamari I would\&#39;ve given even lower ratings at today\&#39;s mealI also had a white fish taco: two tacos brought to me Not bad but probably I was already getting full and didn\&#39;t give a fair tasting opportunity for this main dish! But then I tried corn salsa again Well I found a tiny stone while I was chewing themIt was very tiny but couldn\&#39;t been cracking my teeth! I was lucky enough not to bite the food too hard and was able to spit the stone from my mouth though I showed the stone to the server then manager came to apologize about it Well OK I accepted it and understood it was a mistakebut I stopped eating packed everything into to-go package and left The manager gave me a new salsa for to-go I\&#39;m so sad that one of the popular restaurants in town brought me a stone at my very first visit If anyone ever visit there be conscious about what you chew at this place Loved it! My daughter and I were in town overnight and we were looking for a local non-chain option in Blacksburg We made the right choice! The hostess seated us quickly during s busy lunch hour and we ordered and had our food within 15-20 minutes We both had different types of fish tacos and they were both excellent! There are several healthy options rather than fried which I appreciated It\&#39;s worth a stop! Excellent service and great food! I\&#39;ve only been to Cabo a few times and it\&#39;s always been amazing! Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Blacksburg The servers are always friendly and the food is always amazing So far I\&#39;ve tried the Diablo shrimp salad garlic buffalo shrimp taco honey soy glazed salmon taco and soy ginger shrimp taco (always with a side of the jalepeno cheddar mashers) I wouldn\&#39;t really recommend the salads; the Diablo shrimp salad was good but it wasn\&#39;t great The tacos are really just phenomenal The tortillas are amazing and the ingredients are fresh and flavorful I also absolutely love the jalepeno cheddar mashers as a side This is one of the most accredited restaurants in the Blacksburg area I love the blackened fish taco and the calamari tacos The only reason I am hesitant to give this company 5 stars is the Taco Tuesday deal They advertise that all the tacos are half off however many of the fish and steak tacos are not included Aside from that everything about the business is wonderful and a must stop when in the Blacksburg area The tacos here are absolutely out of this world! I\&#39;m from out of state and I would travel just for the crab dip and Calamari tacos! They have a great alcohol menu and wonderful staff! Their Honey Glazed Salmon Taco is my favorite Cabo is a really good/fun place for friends to hang out over a chat or two They have good service and it\&#39;s not that expensive However at night or in the evening it gets really crowded I love this place and I don\&#39;t love seafood! Yes the name is deceiving Haha they have other meats other than seafood with I appreciate! I really love the Serrano grilled chicken tacos and the jalapeo cheddar smashers! Also get the queso it\&#39;s different which makes it super yum! My boyfriend gets the shrimp tacos and adores them!Definitely a must try for Blacksburg it\&#39;s certainly become one of my favorites in recent months (Also they allow dogs on their outdoor seating! Always a plus in my book!) Went to Cabo Taco around 8:00pm the other night for a couple of tacos and a margarita On the margarita note-- the BEST part of our meal Delicious perfectly strong and $2 off on Mondays Love itEverything else was mediocre Our server was one of the grumpiest unpleasant humans who let his frustration out on all of the patrons They were out of pickled onions (which were an instrumental ingredient in the lemon pepper shrimp tacos) and the salsa was pretty much cold corn My side of slaw tasted old and was not crunchy I did ask if I could have other onions in my tacos (perhaps grilled?) but I received an audible *sigh* from the bartender and some raw onions on my tacos Not impressed Oh my gosh! Yesssssss! The only place to eat in the entire state of Virginia! You have def done the fish taco proud The food is absolutely delicious and the server was so amazing! The corn salsa is fresh and corny lol! The beans are out of this world and so flavorful Thank you for the best food I\&#39;ve had my entire visit to Virginia The buffalo style shrimp tacos are the best thing I\&#39;ve ever eaten! One of the best restaurants in Blacksburg Quality food great atmosphere and overall a great experience If you\&#39;re in town for a weekend definitely hit this place Prices are fair for what you are getting I\&#39;ve yet to have a negative experience here every time I the food is beyond exceptional and the staff is very friendly Best place in Blacksburg hands down We arrived for an early dinner at Cabo Fish Taco As soon as we walked through the door I knew this would be a good experience The staff greeted us and led us to our seats They offered drinks and chips and salsa right away The chips tasted like there were home-made at the restaurant and the salsa was fresh and tasty We also ordered the salsa trio which was awesome! Our tacos came; my wife ordered two blackened grouper tacos and I ordered two steak tacos and we each shared one The tacos were amazing but could have been a bit more flavorful but we added some hot sauce and that gave it the kick it needed Overall great service and wonderful food We\&#39;ll be back! Wow this place is amazing C\&#39;mon 757 you\&#39;re located near the water- we need to be able to execute some fish tacos like these folks! My friend is a Tech alum and brought me here as our last meal before the long drive back home Apparently they have a new brunch menu that\&#39;s pretty amazing I love brunch but being my first time I knew I had to try what they\&#39;re famous for - &#34;fish tacos&#34; I went with the Tavarua Tuna Tacos: blackened lemon pepper rubbed tuna in a kiwi-pineapple fajita with fresh greens tomato avocado mixed cheese &amp; topped with honey-wasabi sauce I enjoyed them but sometimes when I inhaled incorrectly I got some burning sensation in my lungs I honestly loved the tacos so much I could care less about the odd spice side-effect I probably will try something else if I get another opportunity because the honey-wasabi sauce was a little too sweet for my liking The jalapeno cheesy mashers was the side I opted with and fell in love I made myself too full by devouring the carbs before my main entree and honestly no regrets That\&#39;s arguably the best side they offer and now I\&#39;m craving those potatoes all the time The salsa that comes with the meal is a little weird I love the pico-esque tomatoes! It was seasoned so well The corn mixed in was on the sweeter side and I think the different flavor profiles clashed It was either eat the corn or tomatoes never combine No biggie I still ate it all~ My friend\&#39;s friend ordered the queso and it\&#39;s delicious It is a rather small serving though The service was quick and if you go on the weekends (especially game day weekends) definitely go when it opens since there\&#39;s a brunch crowd as well My company went with the brunch options but stated how the sauce for the chicken &amp; waffles taco was also too sweet Perhaps opt to order something that doesn\&#39;t sweeten the sauce that comes on your taco(s) The experience the food and the company made my first time here a blast! I wish they could franchise a restaurant near me! Love the college town feel of this place The food is very good-a variety of options that you will not find at other places the service is good even though they were very busy when we were there Make sure you come hungry We will definitely stop in again next time we are in town! I\&#39;m here on business and we came here after working a long day I ordered the blackened grouper taco which was very good and flavorful Only downfall is that the waiter was not knowledgeable on the drinks when asking for recommendations between the two it wasn\&#39;t helpful Overall I would go back and try something else on the menu! Love Cabo fish taco one of the best in downtown Blacksburg First choice to take visitors when they come to town I try to switch up tacos every time I go to try something new--I love them all my favorite is probably the grilled lemon shrimp but if I\&#39;m cheap I go on Tuesdays for $3 a la carte and get a fish and a chicken The Margs are great as well ALSO BIG PLUS IS THE CHIPS AND CORN SALSA THEY BRING OUT EVERY TIME SO GOOD AND FREE very good service and food! the rasta pasta is definitely not for everyone especially because it was much sweeter than i thought it would be my drink was topped off whenever it got half way Fish Tacos away from a body of water can be scary but they nailed it here Fresh perfectly seasoned and beautifully built We tried them all and not one left anything to be satisfied Pick your meat or heat level and you won\&#39;t be disappointed! Cabo is not worth the hype If you are looking for authentic Mexican food this comes no where close to it We\&#39;ve tried this restaurant twice and have been disappointed each time The tacos were greasy and the fish in them did not have much flavor The sides were also disappointing as the rice was dry and hard The atmosphere of the restaurant is clean and nice and the workers are always pleasant but the food is lackluster at best This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Blacksburg The atmosphere prices food and drinks are outstanding I try to make it to Cabo every time I visit Blacksburg They sell every Tequila they are legally allowed to in the state of VA I would recommend a mix of two tacos the jalapeno mashers as a side and a margarita Love this place while visiting in Blacksburg! Great selection of tacos and other menu items Chips and corn salsa are great for the table I had the grilled serrano chicken tacos and they were a little spicier than I expected thanks to the white cilantro sauce so ask if you\&#39;re not sure how spicy you want them! The side pasta salad is amazing We have also had the tofu salmon and tuna from the specialties taco menu The margaritas are awesome and it\&#39;s great sitting outside when it\&#39;s nice out! Just make sure that if you have a large party you allow time since it\&#39;s so popular but they will text you when you\&#39;re up! Enjoy Cabo!! The best tacos ever! I ordered the soy ginger shrimp tacos  They were AMAZING Definitely try the white peach sangria if they have it I love this place Worth a trip from Roanoke alone But always stop in when heading over to VT for a game Everything is good No need to worry what you order I had the salmon fajita this time around and loved it Lots to eat Also had the shrimp wraps as an entree Yummy Prices are wonder So are the drinks A great place to hang out on any day The sweet Thai chili tofu tacos were my favorite thing to eat in all of Blacksburg when I was a student there Unfortunately I\&#39;m gluten free now for health reasons and can\&#39;t eat them anymore when I go back to visit Tech but overall Cabo is an awesome restaurant! A great go-to for happy hour margs and a quick bite to eat Their homemade salsa is amazing and they keep the complimentary chips coming up until you leave (note: the guacamole is also worth spending a little extra on and they bring you all the ingredients on a nice little platter so you can mix it how you like it)! They also have a nice selection of draft beers and rotate the taps every so often to bring in some more seasonal brewsFor dinner I got a chicken taco and a steak taco (they let you mix and match) - both of which were delicious My go-to side is the black beans and rice which is nothing special but complimented the meal wellAlso it seems that whatever software they use on their tablets to estimate your wait time is wildly inaccurate I have been multiple times during peak hours and have been told that I would have to wait 30 minutes only for them to give me a table five minutes later - not really a bad thing just sort of bizarre Fantastic fresh food! You won\&#39;t be disappointed We were initially told a 45 minute wait The wait was actually 10 minutes The place is a lot larger than it looks Staff friendly ambiance really cool TV\&#39;s to watch if your bored It was really nice good job! This place is great for a lunch date or catching drinks with a friend after work A fish taco isn\&#39;t a common food in this south but Cabo makes you wonder why you never tried it before All the food is made to order except the corn salsa They keep those pre made for you to munch on with chips while you wait for your food I love the margaritas!!! They pair perfect with the tacos!! My favorite tacos are the soy ginger shrimp tacos!!! The white sauce made to drizzle over or dip your taco is literally the icing on the taco there is normally a taco soup of the day the helpful staff will share Cabo is my go to spot when friends and family come to visit because it is out of the box Great time visiting with Virginia and having late lunch with her and Bertie I had the Yellow fin tuna burrito and it was great We also had a crab and shrimp appetizer that was good as well Nice to get into the city once in a while TL;DR: get the tacos and margaritas only for a delicious Cabo taco experienceWe came here maybe 2 years ago and it was definitely memorable Popped in today and got the Thai chili tofu taco beer battered calamari and bangin Baja shrimp tacos which are amazing Unfortunately we also got the citrus carrot salad and Mexi-slaw pictured below which weren\&#39;t very good It seemed as though they were an after thought The mexi-slaw had no dressing it was raw cabbage with pumpkin seeds on top I think if the chef could\&#39;ve dressed it in a lime crema or jalapeo crema it would\&#39;ve livened it up a bit Same thing with the shredded carrots being lacking life If there was jicama maybe watermelon grapefruit and orange it would\&#39;ve been a citrus salad However it did have a dressing but it was poured on top rather than tossing the carrots in it to coat all the carrots The wait staff also isn\&#39;t in uniform so it\&#39;s hard to tell if the waitress dancing around the bar area was a server or a customer enjoying themselves We did ask our waitress to remove the mexi-slaw and she happily obliged If you\&#39;re in the area stop here for some tacos and a refreshing margarita but only get those items Cabo is THE best restaurant in Blacksburg The tacos are my favorite but the burritos and salads are good too I always get the grilled salmon and the fried shrimp tacos with a jumbo el cheapo margarita (or two) Anytime I have guests in town I bring them here as Cabo is a ~must see~ Definitely a must have in Blacksburg! Service is great and food is even better! The tortillas are definitely house made too! I had the beer battered tofu tacos with refried beans -- yum! Everyone else in our party enjoyed their food too The house made corn salsa with the chips are great too Great food! The corn salsa on the table is yummy and unique We had both fish and shrimp tacos We loved the bang bang style the most Highly recommend! LOVED the calamari! We went on a week night so it was not very busy and our food came out super fast highly recommend the beer battered white fish taco! This place gets busy so definitely be prepared for a 30+ minute wait on the weekends BUT best tacos I\&#39;ve ever had I live in Winchester and any time I\&#39;m visiting it\&#39;s just understood that this place is on the itinerary I love Cabo this is the most decent and flavorful restaurant in Blacksburg I would not consider it Mexican but their food is definitely delicious I always order the chicken quesadilla which is huge and savory I think the food is fairly priced for the amount they serve Cabo was one of the first places I ate in Blacksburg; a friend from Tech brought me here for a late dinner It definitely has a lively atmosphere and there\&#39;s TVs showing sports all around We were seated immediately although service slowed down a bit as we sat there We had to wait a while after eating for the check but the waiter was friendly I ordered the lemon grilled shrimp tacos and my friend ordered the bbq mahi tacos Both were delicious! I had the avocado pasta salad side which was delicious My friend had the jalapeno &amp; cheese mashers which were pretty much just mashed potatoes with a kick The food come out very quickly and we were given a huge basket of chips pico and corn salsa to eat while waiting Overall a really great place to eat and would love to come back and try the different tacos they have! Service was great Granted there are not a lot of people here Waitress was super nice and recommended Tavarua runs tacos and they were great I would definitely order those again Food came out in less than 7 minutes If I were to add anything negative I would say tuna should be in strips and seared leaving the center completely rawOtherwise awesome A must in Blacksburg Virginia! The fish tacos were delicious the service was friendly and the ambience was great We\&#39;ll definitely be back Great place for dinner &amp; drinks!They have several margaritas to choose from as well as wine and beer I ordered the Purple Haze margarita and Perfect Wave margarita I enjoyed them both Not weak and pretty yummy!All of the taco entrees come with two tacos and a side They have signature and specialty taco lists that you can mix and match from I ordered a Soy Ginger Shrimp Taco and a Tavarua Tuna Taco with a side of guacamole pasta The Soy Ginger Shrimp Taco was sooo good!!! Very yummy &amp; flavorful!! Didn\&#39;t really taste the ginger in the soy ginger glaze but that\&#39;s fine with me since I\&#39;m not really a fan of ginger anyway The Tavarua Tuna Taco unfortunately wasn\&#39;t as good and it was also kind of dry The guacamole pasta was good but I\&#39;d probably order a different side if I dined here again since they had a few others that sounded pretty appetizing as well Loved it! Creative menu without being complicated Whether you eat vegan fish chicken or beef you\&#39;re covered The options are great If you want a certain taco preparation but want to change the protein they\&#39;ll gladly accommodate your request If you can\&#39;t decide between taco flavors they\&#39;ll give you one of each on a platter or you can order one taco a la carte Score for the girl who wants to try everything!! Don\&#39;t miss the jalapeo cheddar mashers side dish They are worth the indulgence They have a fantastic margarita menu with options for the budget conscious (look for the El Cheapo) all the way up to their version of the Cadillac I settled on the Pura Vida a Costa Rican inspired preparation one of the best taco places and one of the best restaurants at Blacksburg! I got the beer battered shrimp along with the lemon grilled shrimp tacos and they were both amazing price is a little high for the amount you get- they range from $11-$14 for 2 tacos but surprisingly they filled me up! would definitely come here again but not as often due to how expensive it is ): Great food great service Prices may seem high but once you see the food you know it\&#39;s worth it The salmon taco slaps hard GO HERE Seriously amazing Everything we had was out of this world fantastic At our table we ordered about 8 tacos for 3 people and it was a perfect amount One person in our party got a cheese quesadilla for lunch which was amazing as well It doesn\&#39;t seem like you could go wrong with the menu here The interior is small but super cute! Would absolutely recommend and will stop in again if we\&#39;re ever in the area!! Came here for dinner with a friend and had a pleasant experience We were seated outside which was a great idea because they had a fire to keep us warm TIP: Cabo has deals every Tuesday during which you can get specific tacos for $250 each Those tacos include the white fish taco the calamari taco the tofu taco and the chicken tacoI would generally say to not get an appetizers since they provide your table with bottomless chips and dips For the entree I ordered two calamari tacos a tofu taco and a chicken taco All of these were at $250 each Four tacos is more than enough to get an average human being full Fortunately I eat above average and four was perfect My favorite were the calamari tacos The tofu and chicken tacos tied All of them were good! The quality of the tacos could have been a little better more toppings and more ingredients However for $250 each the tradeoffs are worth itDefinitely go on Tuesdays It\&#39;s pretty expensive without the deal ALSO parking is a bit tricky They have their own lot that is to the left of the restaurant which is a little hard to see Don\&#39;t park at the bookstore across the street because you don\&#39;t want to risk getting your car towed The fish itself is good They\&#39;re expensive but the fish seems pretty good so that\&#39;s expected In just giving it a 3 star because I guess I have high expectations in my tacos and prefer the real street tacos It\&#39;s one of the better places in Blacksburg though My favorite place to eat in Blacksburg! The tacos are just soooo good and all of the side dishes are great! I personally love the tofu and shrimp tacos and the avocado pasta salad is incredible! Also delicious margaritas Such a nice vibe too :) This place never disappoints I am so happy they are coming to Roanoke Fresh ingredientsperfectly cooked seafood My fianc and I visited Cabo Fish Taco for the first time today for lunch and enjoyed it so much From the laid back atmosphere and music to the delicious food and excellent service We ordered the crab and shrimp dip as an appetizer and it was amazing I ordered the blackened grouper tacos with the guacamole pasta salad and my fianc ordered the buffalo garlic shrimp with jalapeo cheddar mashed potatoes and we thoroughly enjoyed it! We cannot wait to visit again This place is absolutely delicious! I don\&#39;t know if there are any other words to describe it From the mojitos to the bang bang shrimp tacos everything was awesome On top of the food being crazy good our server was absolutely amazing! The food at cabo is amazing The service is always good Prices are a little expensive for the area but food quality is so great I can\&#39;t complain The only bad thing is parking There\&#39;s less than 10 spots in their parking lotYou should make your season side of plantains permanent on the menu They\&#39;re the best I\&#39;ve ever had (and I\&#39;m from Miami where plantains are everywhere)Food: 5 starsService: 5 starsParking: 2 stars So far this is my favorite restaurant in Blacksburg! I\&#39;m going to be a Hokie in the fall so I come to town and this is the first place I want to go! The lemon grilled shrimp tacos are amazing and below is a picture of the guacamole salmon salad which was a good option for me today because I am on a cleanse My dad whose meal is also in the picture got the barbecue mahi-mahi taco but with grouper instead of mahi Highly recommend 10/10! The service was incredible and our waiter was very knowledgeable with the menu I forgot our waiter\&#39;s name but he was tall and skinny But the food was delicious! I will be returning when I come back This place is amazing - order the shrimp garlic buffalo taco super spicy&amp; super good There are plenty of options that aren\&#39;t fish Including some vegetarian options like a tofu taco The service was really great and we got our food really fast We were rushed out however which was a shame but is understandable due to the popularity of the place! Would recommend to anyone! Great food and margaritas! One of my favorite spots in Blacksburg and I continuously go there They have very consistent service and food I highly recommend getting the jalapeo cheddar mashers as they add a cult favorite among the college community I also love the mahi bbq tacos Don\&#39;t forget taco Tuesday!!!! Late dinner was incredibly tastyFree tortilla chips with corn and tomatoes while you wait Amazing Plus they refill it for you when you run out BBQ Mahi Tacos were moist and flavorful Caborita was on the salty sideAvocado pasta as a side was good but needed more flavorWould I get this dish again? Heck yeah It\&#39;s very filling and so delish Only thing I would change would be getting a different side to try something new Overall I would come back here again and try some of the other menu items because the quality of their food is great Overall: 45 starsOne of the better restaurants in Blacksburg If I have friends/family visiting in the area Cabo Fish Taco is definitely one of the restaurants I recommend Great food for a fair price with decent portions Great environment inside with seating area both inside and outside It can get pretty packed during peak hours so be sure to get there early unless you don\&#39;t mind waiting Only problem is the limited parkingFood Quality: 45 starsOrdered the Crispy Calamari Soy Ginger Shrimp Tacos and Sweet Thai Chili Shrimp Tacos The Crispy Calamari was really good as it was crispy yet tender and wasn\&#39;t too tough to eat I preferred the Cilantro White Sauce more so than the Roasted Red Tomato Sauce One of the better calamari I had The Soy Ginger Shrimp Tacos is typically my go-to menu item It\&#39;s REALLY good but this time around it was a little too sweet and my taco was drenched in the sauce making my tortilla very soggy Custom-ordered the Sweet Thai Chili Shrimp Tacos The original menu item is Sweet Thai Chili Tofu Tacos but substituted the tofu for shrimp This is now my new go-to Definitely custom order a Sweet Thai Chili Shrimp Tacos! Be sure to get the Jalapeno Cheddar Mashers for your side item It\&#39;s basically mashed potatoes with jalapenos and cheddar cheese melted on top Service/Experience: 4 starsDefinitely can get really busy/backed-up if you go during busy hours (dinner time +/- weekends) Goes to show how popular and well-like Cabo Fish Taco is Never really had any problems/complaints about the service Plenty of seating areas inside/outside but again can get really packed during peak hours My only issue with this location is parking Limited parking in the area so you have to find parallel neighborhood parking 1 block down the road Also the traffic in the area can get quite congested making it hard to turn in/out of the area The best restaraunt in Blacksburg! Have literally never had a bad experience here The food is always top notch and the atmosphere is amazing My favorite dish is the soy ginger tacos - they are to die for The only time I was slightly disappointed was when my mashed potatoes were cold and that was because I was with a group of 15 so I let it slide Highly recommend!! This is like the only place to get tacos in Blacksburg VA besides maybe Taco Bell and it is also a really good restaurant Great tacos and chips and salsa I went for the first time on Taco Tuesday $3 tacos is a great deal Great service as well I don\&#39;t know if it\&#39;s a good or bad thing that Cabo Fish Taco opened after I graduated Had I been at Tech when it opened I know I would have been there REGULARLY My bank account however would have taken a serious hit Now it\&#39;s a restaurant my husband and I can look forward to on our frequent visits to Blacksburg The chips and corn salsa is amazing with a perfect level of spice I highly recommend the Caborita which is a step up from their basic margarita (The Workman also very good) As far as tacos I\&#39;ve never had one I didn\&#39;t like I LOVE the Soy Ginger Shrimp tacos so I always get one of those and usually mix it up with one of the house specials If for some reason the specials don\&#39;t sound appetizing (which is super rare for me) I go with a blackened mahi mahi taco I always mix it up with the sides but you can\&#39;t go wrong with jalapeo mashers or Baja rice Also they have a great kids menu We usually get the chicken burrito and it\&#39;s more than enough for our two kids Know in advance that Cabo will be busy if the students are in town My husband and I tried to take this into account this weekend by showing up at 6pm and there was already a wait We just decided to eat at the bar since it was just us It just shows you how good this place is though! I was visiting from out of town and coworkers kept raving about this place! I didn\&#39;t believe that fish tacos in the middle of Virginia could be that good but I was wrong! These tacos were deliciousTwo tacos to a plate and they are hefty servings The BBQ Mahi tacos were the best! All the fixings inside the tacos are just the right portion Each taco plate comes with a side but the sides are unnecessary I had the beans and they were pretty disgusting; I\&#39;m hoping it was just a bad batch where they didn\&#39;t mix the beer into the received beans mixture properlyThe ambience is really chill and the decor is new and fun Parking in the back is scarce so if you come at peak hours be prepared to spend time hunting If you are visiting Blacksburg or a freshman just starting at the university you should plan a meal here Cran and shrimp dip was good the pita triangles freshly made to dip it were out of this world Banging shrimp tacos were filling and a great flavor Service was excellent Would recommend! This is our favorite spot in town The food is always fresh and the staff is exceptional We were kind of skeptical at first (fish and tacos?) but we now make Cabo our top pick almost always It\&#39;s the best in town! If you don\&#39;t like fish they have other things to put on your tacos Hint- the jalapeo mashers are amazing! Busy the whole time we were there but didn\&#39;t feel stressed to leave We ordered the guacamole starter without the jalapeo on top It was the right size serving and the chips were warmed and seasoned Yum Emma ordered the lemon shrimp tacos with the rice side We were so full neither of us had room for our sides I ordered the soy ginger tacos Besides being messy they were super yummy We would both get our orders again which is saying a lot as there are other appealing options on the menu There is a nice bar (small) and two tvs There are a few rooms and a second floor The parking is tricky but we got lucky! I recently went to Cabo for a Bumble Bizz meet-up because I read on the reviews that they had great appetizers to share The food was super yummy and we were able to sit outside on the patio Such a great atmosphere! I had calamari tacos here they were very good I loved them The service is friendly and Pretty good on all points except parking Parking is a nightmare all over Blacksburg but the tiny lot and giant cars at Cabo were harrowingInterior had way too many kids running around and the floor was sticky so we opted to sit outsideServer showed up quickly and returned with drinks just as fast We ordered the blackened mahi and the lemon marinated shrimp tacos Chips and salsa appeared in a trice and the tacos showed up before we even finished the salsaBoth sets of tacos were excellent but the shrimp won the day The shells are flour tortillas fried in oil A little too much oil was left in the shell but the texture and flavor were spot on The fish and shrimp were dressed up in the shell but not so much that it covered the up the meat Very nice balanceA nice pint of beer put the bill at somewhere near $30 Not bad for that speed of service and quality of food After all that walking for a college tour we needed to sit down and refuel - and I needed a drink! Cabo Fish Taco to the rescue for unique Mexican flavor and flare! Plenty of different margaritas; I\&#39;ll have to go back just to try another But the real star here are the tacos! We had the BBQ Grouper and also the Banging Baja using calamari that just melted in your mouth! The grouper stayed in nice chunks and how they get the breaded squid to be crisp and tender simultaneously is a trick! Both were served in toasted flour tortillas with slaw and salsa (different types for each) - no soggy tacos here! My one &#34;ok&#34; item was the homemade guac appetizer (we always try the guac to see what\&#39;s up) It needed more seasonings in general but having the onion and jalepenos on the side was applauded by some in our group Call me a taco snob but for the life of me I can not get over the fact that all their tacos are served on flour tortillas What an atrocity for my taste buds! the food is delicious and the service is incredible The drink menu is soooo long and dank! Okay but one thing--- THE SIDES Are  SO MEH How can you serve me a sexy delicious shrimp taco with the blandest side in the effing world!!!!! Otherwise 10/10 Awesome! Great drinks and really fresh food - loved it! Had the Shrimp Fajita tonight and my wife had the Garlic Buffalo Shrimp Taco - we both were very happy with our choices- never have left this place hungry! Good tasting food however it would be better if the portions were bigger and the food inside the taco was actually warm Great place to take someone for a casual dinner Not too fancy not too sleazy Also presentation of food could be better I worked here while I was in college about 8 years ago and this place hasn\&#39;t changedthe food at least They have redesigned the inside quite a bit but the food remains spot on I crave this place and I finally got back to Blacksburg to eat here again The angry margarita with a splash of strawberry (I ask for it that way) is on point! Their chips corn salsa and queso is a must My personal favorite entree is one soy ginger shrimp taco one bbq mahi-mahi taco and a side of the baja rice Just absolute perfection! I couldn\&#39;t remember our server\&#39;s name but the ticket said &#34;Doody&#34; so not sure if that was his real name or nickname but he was great very attentive laid-back and kind I cant wait to come back and visit! Great service Great food Great deals My favorite side dish has to be the guacamole pasta salad and I love taco Tuesdays!! It was a less of an experience than I expected Although I expected Mexican I found loud Music college age young crowd with only made up tacos The taste of food was ok Staff was attentive Dressing of staff could be a little less casual The price was quite expensive for what you receive Very solid food! Everything I tasted from the chips to the crap dip to the fish tacos to the seafood linguine were very tasty The food might not necessarily blow you out of the water but it is very satisfying/filling No real complaints there Cabl Fish Taco offers a neat lively environment and lots of variety on the menu I found myself having difficulty choosing between the multiple items that sounded good My main complaint is that getting a table was a pain Cabo does not take reservations so we arrived to the restaurant gave a name and number and had to wait in a small/cramped area in the front of the restaurant for around 45 minutes This was a normal weekday around dinner time in the spring/summer I can only imagine how busy it gets on weekends or during homecoming or parents weekend That being said I probably would eat here again however I would do so going in with some sort of strategy in order to minimize wait time I would recommend Cabo to others but with a caveat The food will leave everyone feeling very content Blacksburg is definitely a college town and the food options tend to cater to students Although choices in the area may be somewhat limited it is always appreciated to have a solid taco spot and some dangerously easy drinking beverages at very generous prices Cabo Fish Taco fills the void making the perfect place to celebrate after exams or to go just because you\&#39;re craving a margarita Cabo Fish Taco despite its name has a pretty wide range of Mexican food (and taco fillings) Chips and salsa are delivered to every table but there are &#34;Small Stuff&#34; such as their house made guacamole or &#34;Baja Shrimp &amp; Crab Dip&#34; that can kick the standard chip dip up a notch Also although the menu advertises flour tortillas I\&#39;d like to note you can ask to upgrade to corn tortillas should you so desire for $1 extra As an adamant advocate for corn over flour I\&#39;d say it is well worth the investment- I just wish the option was more visible on the menu so it wasn\&#39;t necessary to ask Also thanks to the tip from a local we were dining withyou can mix and match the taco types so you don\&#39;t have to commit to one particular variety for the two that come with a typical order As to be expected from the Baja-style they advertise they beer batter everything from calamari to shrimp to tofu I think their specialty tacos are where they really shine though Although the sauce was a bit sweeter than expected I really like the soy ginger shrimp tacos (Beer battered shrimp tossed in a Soy Ginger Glaze served with cabbage tomato avocado and mixed cheese and finished with sesame seeds and scallions)Don\&#39;t forget to grab a drink to wash down those tacos either Happy hour seems to be quite kind going from 3pm to 9pm and offering discounts on already fair drink prices They\&#39;ve got a decent list of margarita options too all of which can be served on the rocks or blended My favorite was the &#34;The Original Caborita&#34; (Made with Jose Cuervo especial Tequila Triple-Sec OJ and fresh house mix) since the others were a bit too sweet for my palateSo if you\&#39;re visiting Virginia Tech or just because you\&#39;re passing through Blacksburg consider grabbing a cheap and tasty meal at Cabo Fish Taco This is a nice place to eat We were served some nachos with salt which u don\&#39;t see so much The corn salsa was ok not my favorite Next time would see if the have alternate My wife and I got some of their taco\&#39;s She had the grouper and I had the ancho pulled pork taco special They both were flavorful You get 2 so if your real hungry it may not suffice My wife\&#39;s beans and rice was too spicy that she didn\&#39;t eat it so wont get that again I got their pasta avocado salad and it was good Wouldn\&#39;t get jalapeos on it if you have spicy tacos though They have other items on the menu that look good as well I would definitely go back I had 3 tacos shrimp fish and chicken They were all great Chips and salsa here are also fantastic Margaritas are awesome and made from scratch Nice beer selection too You can never get a bad meal at Cabo They bring out endless chips and their corn salsa and if you have more self control than me you\&#39;ll probably only get one or two bowls of it Get the sesame soy ginger shrimp tacos and you\&#39;ll never go back!! I\&#39;ve been there countless times with the intention of trying something new but have always gone back to those sweet glazed shrimps Enjoy one of their mojitos and you\&#39;ll be in paradise! Great place for truly delicious shrimp and fish tacos Great blend of flavors excellent service and cool atmosphere Very pleasant experience and highly recommend it We are from Texas so tacos are a staple for us and Cabo\&#39;s hit the spot! Drink specials that you cant beat and tacos that are a wide variety! I came here for dinner one night and was pleased with the selection Everything does have a spicy taste to it for people who are sensitive to spices You get corn salsa as well for freeI would go back! We went on taco Tuesday not worth any pictures :) Drinks - I ordered the perfect wave (margarita) The server asked if I wanted the single or double I prefer it to be strong/flavorful but I don\&#39;t want a jumbo He said they could do a double in the regular size I said that sounds good! The drink was very weak like juice and he charged me $24!!!!!! For an appetizer we ordered the &#34;house made&#34; guac and chips It was definitely NOT house made It tasted like the packaged guac you buy in a grocery store only to never buy again because it\&#39;s terrible and tastes like pured baby food with too many preservatives They did add peppers and onions to the top to make it less obvious but it was still a far cry from homemade guac! Tacos - just okay we got the taco specials honey Saracha fish tacos and chimichurri steak tacos Overall ~ Underwhelming Always a delicious go-to for lunch or dinner The seafood is fresh and so are the creative sides (think watermelon mozzarella salad) The upstairs is a bit loud with the low ceilings but it is a college town after all Yum! Great tacos salmon blackened and honey Margarita was flavorful along with great service Great atmosphere will always be found here Never been disappointed with any meal big fan of the shrimp and the salmon tacos Outside is set up similar to a beach restaurant sand is included The kids it It is located conveniently off of Virginia Tech It has limited parking so it might be easier to park at the pay parking ($1/hr less than 5 min walk) or neighborhood parking The portions are pretty big but the food was not worth the price Furthermore the guacamole pasta salad had more onions than it has avocado Love this place! Food is great  and wait staff always friendly and helpful I always make it a point to stop and eat when traveling for work Cabo is one of the best spots in Blacksburg! The menu is outstanding and the margaritas are to die for We were in town on business for a month and ate every Tuesday here! The calamari may be some of the best I\&#39;ve ever had if you go it\&#39;s a must get! Service is prompt and they have a fantastic atmosphere! Recommend this place to everyone Most unique spot in BlacksburgBuffalo garlic shrimp is my go to All the sides are fantastic Tons of different margaritas I recommend the Perfect Wave Corn salsa was very fresh I ordered steak fajitas but got salmon fajitas I\&#39;m definitely glad they messed it up The salmon was cooked perfectly and had tons of flavor Definitely will go back when in the area Wow! Awesome! Started with chips and fresh corn salsa I ordered the Ahi Tuna tacos and they were great Will definitely order them again My son had salmon fajitas and loved them Everything super fresh! Great food Great atmosphere Perfect place to end a long day Cabo salad with salmon hit the spot Staff incredibly friendly Definitely on my return list Food was okay but bland Service is so slow I could have grown the wheat ground the flour and made the tortillas myself in less time The only reason I didn\&#39;t give this place 5 stars is because of our waitress She was attentive but had absolutely no personality what so ever very stand offish and never cracked a smile But the food was amazing! Some of the best tacos I\&#39;ve ever had! This place is always disappointing The drinks are mediocre the food is a weird combination of Mexican Tex-Mex and southwest Virginia and the atmosphere can\&#39;t decide whether it\&#39;s catering to undergrads or families Whenever I decide to give it another chance I regret it Always has great service and great food The waiters are always very conscious of my allergies to make sure I was safe The food was amazing and they have great deals for college kids on taco nights Cabo is key to the Blacksburg experience Stopped in on a sunny Saturday the patio seating was nice Chips were crispy &amp; salted the salsa had fresh tomatoes on top but horrible Green Giant corn niblets on the bottom We ordered the BBQ grilled Grouper which was delicious just the right seasoning &amp; a little heat The tortillas were soft but did not break and held the filling together The beer battered white fish taco needed some type of sauce or salsa to liven it up My black beans and rice contained more of the corn niblets Overall I would go back &amp; upgrade this to 4 starts if they would just get rid of the corn niblets! The food just isn\&#39;t good I went here once just after moving to Blacksburg and again a few months ago Their corn salsa is bizarre Watery bland and not something you would find in Mexico There is nothing even close to authentic on their menu The tacos are sad flour tortillas wrapped around too sweet meat It\&#39;s not cheap and it\&#39;s not deliciousservice is 4/5did not use bathroom Definitely our favorite dining spot over the past four years when visiting daughter at VA Tech Consistently good food drink and friendly staff A great place to ease the pain if you are paying out of state tuition premium! Wait was long as we anticipated seeing it was a Saturday night but I would consider driving down 4 hours again for their stupid amazing crab dip and warm pita bread triangles and their stupid amazing tacos I dream about Cabo fr fr y\&#39;all Great food very fast service The dining space is cramped and crowded--expect to be shouting throughout your meal but anticipate an energetic and lively dining experience My dad and I sat in upstairs for dinner somewhat secluded from the main dining area and it was still loud Parking is also very limited Still 3/5 star-worthy because of the great food and the quick and friendly service Dined here the Friday night prior to VT playing ODU so the wait was pretty long little over an hour We did some shopping while we waited and the wait was well worth it! We started off with the Baja Shrimp and Crab dip to start off our meal delicious and a huge bowl we could not finish We each ordered fish tacos; I ordered the Tavarua (Tav-A-Roo) Tuna Tacos my husband had the Garlic Buffalo Shrimp Tacos and my beautiful niece (a student at VCOM and real catch guys!) had the Lemon Grilled Shrimp Tacos They were all fantastic best I\&#39;ve ever had Our server was great too! Will definitely return here when back in Blacksburg Best tacos I\&#39;ve ever had! Can\&#39;t wait to come back here next time we visit Blacksburg! Great place with very friendly staff Extremely good food especially tacos of course I often take friends and family here when they are visiting Will get busy during the semester I have had the privilege of eating at the DDD flagship Cabo in Charlotte plus 3 visits to this Blacksburg location The Cabo patio is the place here as Charlotte\&#39;s patio is the porch area in front All the dining areas inside and out are comfortable and inviting Service is always good southern hospitality is key The staff are all attentive fast and enthusiastic The food is always good you can\&#39;t go wrong with any choice The tacos are puffy which is a nice touch and not very common you will dig it Variety is apparent and there is no problem mixing and matching items the servers will help They get it right I tend to complicate my orders and each time here the delivery to the table was accurate My blackened Tuna Taco and Tequila Rock fish taco really blew me away 2 is enough for me but I was so tempted to get 2 more Trying to practice a little more will power Cabo Fish Taco is the MUST Try restaurant in Blacksburg VA! Cabo is the best place to eat at in Blacksburg and it isn\&#39;t even close Everything on the menu is delicious I have been over a dozen times and can\&#39;t complain about a thing! Easiest 5 star rating I\&#39;ve ever given I was delighted to find such a decent place to have Mexican food in downtown Blacksburg Service is attentive and food is worth the money I ordered the Fajitas with steak and my friend ordered the Epic Tuna Burrito we both satisfied with the taste and portion Outdoor eating is available Beers are served Oh my gosh I\&#39;m usually not a huge fan of tacos and normally I never crave one but I could eat the taco\&#39;s here for daysThe tacos at Cabo Fish Taco are amazing Not only do the ingredients taste fresh but they\&#39;re full of flavor as well My favorite component of it was probably the taco shell I absolutely LOVED the texture -- it was chewy yet crispy with the perfect amount of flakiness I\&#39;m not sure how to accurately describe the shell but it was hot and deliciousI got the lemon grilled tuna with baja rice and my friend got the blackened mahi-mahi The baja rice was okay to me but the combination of the fish and the sauce that came on top of the taco was extremely flavorful and tasty; however I would recommend not getting both the blackened mahi-mahi and lemon grilled tuna because I found that both fishes tasted very similarOverall really good service and food! It leaves you feeling pretty full because of all the complimentary chips and salsa and the perfect tacos to top it off! ---------------------------------Overall:- My first visit to Cabo was in 2009 and it was an actually an accident we were looking for another restaurant but couldn\&#39;t find it Nevertheless years later it is still my FAVORITE restaurant in Blacksburg Campus food will always beat out the surrounding restaurant but if I have friends visiting this is my go to place THE STAPLE DISH: Do not leave Cabo without getting the shrimp and crab dip I don\&#39;t care what else you order but you MUST order the shrimp and crab dip You will thank me later and regret that you did not try it sooner ---------------------------------Attire: - Very casual ---------------------------------Cost Estimate: -Shrimp and Crab dip ~$10 (YOU HAVE TO ORDER THIS) - Margarita ~$7-8 - 2 Tacos ~$10-11---------------------------------Occasions to visit: - Happy Hour with friends- Guest are in town visiting - Date night - Celebration dinner - Quick and filling lunch ---------------------------------Dcor: - A very rustic interior with wooden tables and wooden booths Some tables will have metal high top chairs as well- The interior is larger than expected There are two floors a sun room like area and outdoor seating I would say Cabo can usually accommodate parties up to about 10- Very dim lighting Sometimes it\&#39;s a little hard to read the menu or you know take a good food pic - Outdoor seating is especially nice for the spring summer and fall Metal table chairs and an umbrella to block some of the sun---------------------------------Service: - Depends on the night and the crowd I\&#39;ve had great service and I\&#39;ve experience very slow service This however should not be a reason to deter you from trying Cabo ---------------------------------What to order: - THE SHRIMP AND CRAB DIP Again I will say it over and over you HAVE to try the shrimp and crab dip The pita has a crisp exterior but when you load up that bite with the dip you get a euphoric experience of flavor and texture The pita is soft and fluffy on the inside and paired with the hot creamy dipyou will die in tex-mex heaven I have dreams about this shrimp and crab dip I would drive 4 hours for this shrimp and crab dip If I could swim in this dip I would dive right in Order it Order it now! - Soy Ginger shrimp taco This is probably the most flavorful taco It\&#39;s sweet it\&#39;s sticky it\&#39;s delicious - Beer Battered Fish taco It\&#39;s so simple but so good! For those who want a more mild flavor profile this is the taco for you - Jalapeno mashers Is it spicy? If you want it to be Cabo now places the jalapenos on top so you can customize your spice level It\&#39;s the best side dish I wouldn\&#39;t even mess with the other stuff - SHRIMP AND CRAB DIP Ok I\&#39;ll stop but really you have to order it This has always been a personal favorite restaurant of mine! The food is amazing the staff is very nice and it\&#39;s in the heart of downtown Nopalito salad is bean salad with a teensy bit of nopalitos in it IF you have a bite with a sliver of cactus you MIGHT taste it Don\&#39;t count on itThe tacos are excellent though They are 2 per plate We got different orders and traded one The barbecue mahi-Mahdi was very tasty The tuna with wasabi sauce was fantasticThere are many variations of margarita on the drinks menu And mine wit jalapeos was very tasty There was just enough to pepper to tasteReggae playing in the background was a plus I\&#39;ve been to Cabo tons of times since I came to Tech and I\&#39;ve received amazing food each visit Every time my friends or family visit this is where we bring them The waiters and waitresses are very friendly and the service is great The food is 100% worth the price and wait Will continue to come back! By far my favorite restaurant Staff could dress a little more appropriately but the food is phenomenal! Enjoyed a nice lunch on the patio I got Soy Ginger shrimp tacos Delicious! Received free chips and salsa Salsa was just ok Made with lots of corn Service was ok not outstanding Felt it was a a little pricy for 2 tacos but would go back Great tacos We got the cod calamari and shrimp and all 3 were delicious I really liked the guacamole pasta side which was unique and yummy I thought the free salsa had too much corn but it was free My sangria didn\&#39;t have the fresh fruit I expected It had 2 maraschino cherries and a slice of orange and a lot of ice Would skip the drink Service was great and food arrived incredibly fast It was my first time while dropping my child off for school I had two different types of tacos shrimp in cash They were both excellent At the table there\&#39;s a salmon salad and that was outstanding The corn salsa in the beginning is Just OK I could use a little bit more of a kick I thought the menu is extensive and varied I can\&#39;t wait to go back Bad service and not that many good options that are not seafood Also the sea food is not fresh The fish in the tacos is expertly cooked and the crunchy tortillas add a great textural mixThe best part or our dinner was our server Megan She was a pro with a quick wit and an engaging personality She had us laughing histerically and made our meal extra entertainingNice outside atmosphere great service excellent food and a memorable experience Be sure to ask for Megan This is one of my favorite restaurants in Blacksburg All of the beer battered tacos are quality but the specialty ones are awesome too and have great sauces The service has gotten so much better since I started going to VT in 2013 You can be in and out pretty quickly if it\&#39;s not too slammed but you can also take the time to enjoy your meal and drinks Would definitely recommend I wish the shellfish was sauted rather than breaded and fried but our family of five all ordered different things and all were very good  They were very generous with the baskets of machines and salsa too I was pretty full by the time the entrees came out ! Best place in blacksburg! Tacos are to die for and the taco tuesday deal is great for any student looking to eat great food on a budget if they\&#39;re running low on meal plan money If you haven\&#39;t been to Cabo Fish Taco do yourself a favor and pay them a visit if you\&#39;re ever in Blacksburg!! This is hands down the best restaurant in Blacksburg!! I live in Miami now and I constantly crave Cabo Whenever I\&#39;m back in town this is the first place I visit It\&#39;s that good To start every table gets complimentary chips and chunky salsa The chunky salsa is some mix of tomatoes jalapenos corn and cilantro- fantastic way to start the meal For your main meal you HAVE to try their tacos Any of them They\&#39;re all good My favorites are the lemon grilled shrimp or the calamari You get to choose 1 side with your tacos and I always opt for the guacamole pasta salad- it\&#39;s amazing Their margaritas are also quite good! For those on a budget they have the &#34;El Cheapo&#34; or &#34;Workmans&#34; margaritas that are under $5 Finally the ambiance is fantastic The building was constructed in 1848 and was originally a church The decor is interesting and the staff is always super friendlyMake sure to try this place if you\&#39;re ever in the area- you won\&#39;t regret it!! So many great varieties of tacos to choose from but my favorite was the Grapefruit Curry Scallops Taco-it was out of this world awesome! Mexi Slaw was fabulous too! This is probably one of the best places to grab a bite near Virginia Tech campus We were there for lunch during one of the move-in days The restaurant was busy as expected We were seated rather quickly But there were people waiting for tables during the whole time we were there The service was friendly But since they were so busy we did have to try to get their attention to get more water to get our bill and even to pay for the meal We were sharing a burrito They split the burritos and mashed potatoes in two separate plates That was really niceThe complimentary chips and salsa were interesting I thought the chips were a little too thick And I did not care for the corn salsa that came with the chips We had steak burritos and steak tacos The Steak tacos were good and very flavorful The steak burritos had too much beans and a little too salty in my opinion but it was still very good  The mashed potato that came with the burritos was delicious Wonderful selection Unique place with a friendly atmosphere We love sitting outside and the propane heaters make it available even on chilly evenings I am partial to spicy shrimp tacos Get the soy ginger tacos you\&#39;ll thank me laterEl Cheapo margarita is also really good for a good price Usually busy and loud but the food is always good and the servers nice I love this place! I heard from my friends that visiting this place was a staple to my Blacksburg experience My three friends and I went here for dinner on a Friday night and much to my surprise we didn\&#39;t have to wait that long for a table! The service was fantastic and the food was aahhh-mazing! I really recommend this place for anyone visiting Blacksburg Plus the ambiance is trendy The main dishes we got were pretty good the queso was unimpressive and the margaritas were not worth the money Will probably go back when too lazy to make tacos on our own but not likely to become a place we go regularly This location reminded me of the first time I ate at the CLT restaurant The last time I ate at the CLT location the taco\&#39;s were not as good as previous visits I had to do the BBQ Mahi taco\&#39;s so I\&#39;d have a true comparison They were exactly what I expected and the reason I wanted to eat here The fish was cooked perfect and the shells were not greasy The co-worker that was with me actually was with me last trip to the CLT location He agreed this location was on point with the food Our waitress was great and she didn\&#39;t miss a beat the entire meal The beers came out quick and the food was ready in about 10 minutes after ordering I sat outside and enjoyed the nice weather There were quite a few people there on the patio as well If you\&#39;re wanting to sit out there I would get there before 6:30pm to get a seat Small parking lot but there is plenty of street parking and other lots nearby Just a nuggetI spoke to a guy who cooks at this place who works at a nearby hotel He explained how serious they take their food Enjoyed talking with him about how they prep and cook the dishes we all love Everything was incredibly good We stopped in on vacation and we hope to go through Blacksburg in the future just to stop here Remains my favorite place to eat in Blacksburg The food is consistently delicious and I\&#39;ve never had a problem with the wait staff-they\&#39;re always kind and attentive Huge fan of their taco Tuesday and margarita deals during the week My favorites are the chicken tacos spinach and artichoke dip and the workmans margarita One of the BEST places to eat in Blacksburg Truly a local joint The food is fantastic The only con is that it\&#39;s a little on the pricier side (roughly $9 for two tacos and a small side) but in my opinion it\&#39;s worth it to try! It gets crowded really quickly so go at an off time and you\&#39;ll get much better servicePSA:Free chips and corn salsa per table Taco Tuesday: $250 per taco! Dude go to Cabo If you\&#39;ve never been you owe it to yourself to go check it out at least once My favorite there are the buffalo shrimp tacos They\&#39;re fresh and spicy and full of flavor My husband isn\&#39;t a big fish fan but he really enjoys the southwest chicken wrap My 5 year old son really likes their quesadilla too!Bonus points be being super fast to bring out food AND having superb outdoor seating Like most downtown Blacksburg restaurants parking isn\&#39;t ideal but better than most and I *think* cabo validates parking for the kent square garage right across the street but I could be wrong If so there\&#39;s usually a spot back on church street If I could give 10 stars I would This is my favorite restaurant The BBQ Mahi tacos are out of this world Workmens margarita and the jalapeo mashers complement the meal wonderfully The restaurant is a little small but it\&#39;s great because it keeps the crazy down Cabo is one of my favorite places to eat in Blacksburg The wait is usually not bad and if there is one they will text you when it\&#39;s ready Food is great They will bring chips and an interesting but good corn and tomato salsa Their margaritas are large and well priced I recommend the Workmans Cabo has a great atmosphere They turned their parking lot into a beach for the Summer Solstice Festival The staff are very vibrant and attentive however the food left much to be desired This is one of the best restaurants that I have ever eaten at I went with a party of 9 and we were seated immediately The service was awesome and the staff was friendly We were served our meals very fast The waitress was on top of our drink and chip refill as well I ordered the rojitas fajitas and it was AMAZING! Best meal I have had in a very very long time 10/10 highly recommend I wish I had one in my home town :( My absolute favorite restaurant in Blacksburg I\&#39;m an alumni and this restaurant is always my first stop when I make a visit back Try the spinach and artichoke dip Also try the Soy Ginger Shrimp Tacos (I haven\&#39;t found shrimp tacos that compare anywhere else) ok the tacos here are pretty damn goodI was skeptical as they were on flour tortillas and had some somewhat non-traditional combinations but I can get down The bbq mahi tacos were great not sweet the slaw works perfectly But the real winner was the garlic buffalo shrimp tacos InsaneI didn\&#39;t like either of the sides I got but the tacos were on point Out of towner first time here! I got the tuna tacos and they were packed with flavor and hearty I like their salsa more like fresh pico de gallo though Enjoyed the outdoor seating and service was good Let me start by saying the food was pretty good we had the carne asada tacos and the chicken quesadilla Neither of us were a fan of the rice or refried beans they seemed very dry and way to much dry spices I\&#39;m giving this 3 stars because of the waitress she never gave us her name she rushed is like they were packed and needed our table for the next round of guests We were looking for somewhere we could relax after a long drive After our food was given to us by another staff member she never cane back to see how it was We had to ask another server of she could find our server so we could get our bill Unfortunately I would probably never return to this location ONLY because of the bad service Great restaurant awesome staff Food is incredible my choices Is the tuna wrap and jalapeo masher Corn salsa is superb 2nd time stopping here Service is quick staff is nice food is solid Mahi Mahi tacos were excellent Amazing place! Nestled in the Blacksburg college town this restaurant is a place you do not want to miss! The tortillas for tacos are homemade and have a crunch and all ingredients taste fresh and local! Waiters are attentive and nice! If you\&#39;re visiting for a college tour don\&#39;t hesitate to ask the staff about their time in Blacksburg/Virginia Tech! They are willing to help you out and give very useful information! If I end up going to Virginia Tech I will make sure to frequent this place! I\&#39;ve heard a lot of good things about this place from friends and family so I was excited to finally try this place You can definitely tell it\&#39;s a popular place for the locals and students They give you free chips and salsa but I wasn\&#39;t a huge fan of it The salsa was made with fresh tomatoes and corn but since I don\&#39;t like tomatoes I only ate the corn The chips were alright; I\&#39;ve had better My sister ordered the Banging Baha shrimp tacos (this is one of her favorites) with jalapeno cheddar mashers and I got the daily special - jerk shrimp taco - with the guacomole potato salad I got a taste of both and they tasted pretty similar to me which isn\&#39;t a bad thing since I thought they were still good However I expected my jerk shrimp to have more of that spice flavor Regardless I enjoyed my tacos and the sides and understand the hype about this place If I get a chance to visit Blacksburg again I would revisit to try the other options The fish here is amazing My tuna burrito was like heaven in a tortilla The Baja rice was seasoned and sweet Even though it was crowded our waiter a med school student managed to find time to help us find the right meal as one of our party members had food restriction I would recommend this restaurant for anyone in the area My sister my daughters and myself had dinner here after watching a movie It wasn\&#39;t very busy I suppose because it was the day before Thanksgiving and most of the college students have gone home My sister and I ordered the specials and split them with the kids She had (if I remember correctly) the blackened mahi mahi with lemon cream sauce and I had the Korean BBQ steak tacos We shared an appetizer of shrimp and crab dip Everything was flavorful and amazing The crab dip is addictive and definitely a must-try Amazing food and fun atmosphere in a really cool part of town As a visitor to Blacksburg I was impressed I didn\&#39;t think fish tacos as good as these existed in so far away from an ocean The shrimp tacos were on point! I had the garlic buffalo shrimp tacos and the soy ginger shrimp tacos and both were to die for In addition I got this hidden side gem called guacamole pasta! Great food great drinks and great service Every time I go into Cabo I am not disappointed I recommend the ginger soy shrimp and the fried cactus special Please make it a regular item! The food and the service are almost always terrific The margaritas however have been disappointing Still one of our favorite summer time favorites! Enjoyed the BBQ mahi-mahi tacos The rice was a bit undercooked and cold Those who ordered mashed potatoes received theirs cold as well Overall the food was good however Regular margarita was just right not too sweet Service was nice but a bit spotty I appreciate that they have compact fluorescent lights to save some money in lighting but the blue color makes this place feel like an office Swap those out for a warmer color to improve the ambience Food is amazing and it\&#39;s always the first place I want to eat when I visit the Burg But never order their Skinny RitaI asked for it without the Splenda (gross and that\&#39;s not a skinny Rita!)the bartender pushed me to the Sourpatch and assured me it was just a &#34;splash&#34; of sour mix and a skinny Ritathat drink was ALL sour mix!Love the chicken Serrano salad and any fish taco though!!! Don\&#39;t believe the hype The lemon grilled tacos were just okay Beans &amp; rice had no flavor Beer battered calamari was rich with breading and sauce was mostly mayo A lot VT a friends pushed this place but I was not impressed I\&#39;m writing this review about my take-out order experience Cabo wants you to experience the taste of Baja and they don\&#39;t disappoint The take-out order was as good as the in - restaurant experience; the food is fresh and delicious When I called in the order they said it would take 15 to 20 minutes and it took exactly that When I arrived the restaurant was packed and with a lot of people waiting outside so I thought there would be a delay but there was not! I walked up to the bar and in my turn told the bartender that I had a take out order He was friendly and busyWhich was nice to experience because those two words don\&#39;t often go hand-in-hand in restaurants in our college town It took only a minute for him to get my order and ring me up and I was out! Cabo is kind of expensive but it\&#39;s worth it The food is remarkably good and you get enough of it to make the price well worth it I\&#39;ve had my share of fish tacos from vendors along the beach in Southern California and Cabo get it right Instant favorite! Food is ridiculously yummy and very reasonably priced Garlic buffalo shrimp tacos and jalapeo mashers are the BEST Perfectly cooked calamari Love the shrimp and crab dip + the lemon grilled shrimp tacos as well Very chill laid-back atmosphere Best for get-togethers with friends Very limited parking but it is on Main Street after all I\&#39;ve been three times in the past two months and I will keep going back for more! Great price Great food Carne asada steak taco is my favorite Waitress was very nice after five minutes the stools gets old very uncomfortable Other than that place is great food is awesome I LOVE Cabo Fish Taco It tends to be crowded but that is just a reflection of the great offerings There specialty tacos are all on point but my personal favorite is the BBQ Mahi Taco I\&#39;m a fish taco purist so many of the tacos didn\&#39;t sound appealing to me I tried the fried white fish taco which was my fav taco while living in SoCal Decent My daughter tried the grilled BBQ Mahi taco She loved it! I decided to try the well-reviewed Soy ginger shrimp taco too So pleasantly surprised! I will give that taco an enthusiastic 5 star rating It was really tasty! Margaritas were tasty too Will definitely visit again when I\&#39;m Blacksburg Cabo is literally the most delicious thing I\&#39;ve had ever The buffalo shrimp taco is my life I crave this meal no matter where I am Service is good One thing I wish would change is their side dishes not a huge fan of those If you\&#39;re in Blacksburg though this is the place to eat!!! The fish tacos are to DIE for!!! This was a great spot to enjoy a brew and some delicious tacos Definitely try more than one type because they are all good! Love it! I enjoy coming on Tuesdays to catch the $250 taco deal and never was disappointed by the food The calamari and mahi mahi tacos are super yummy The Taco Tuesday deal is limited to a selection of tacos but this does not dissuade me I usually get 4 tacos when I go so the deal definitely does it for me The fried calamari is amazing much better than the usual chain restaurant fare Get that as your appetizer The tacos were honestly kind of hit or miss Nice atmosphere inside though with what looked like soft natural light that wasn\&#39;t too bright They could get rid of a few TVs though IMO I stopped in for dinner and had the buffalo chicken tacos They were deep fried and full of yummy goodness Seems like this is the place to relax and have a few beverages and chips/salsa on their patio The staff is very attentive Good tacos and variety of drafts Service was spot on and the kitchen had our food out in a jiffy Special of the day spicy beer battered cod was tasty would definitely recommend and revisit this establishment Best margarita\&#39;s and shrimp tacos ! First time here and I just order the special which was the shrimp tacos has mashed potatoes with jalapeos - so good ! Will defiantly be back Also the waiting staff made the cost enjoyable televisions are located at every angle so you don\&#39;t have to miss the i game or just want to watch the news to strike up conversations at the table Excellent food and service The tuna tacos were cooked perfectly! The salsa was fresh and was really good as well Casual and laid back atmosphere and lots of TV\&#39;s to keep me occupied while I ate Can\&#39;t wait to go back The crab dip is incredible but I think the best part of that appetizer is the crispy pita pieces that come with it I love buffalo wings so I ordered the garlic buffalo shrimp tacos and finished it all because it was just that good It gets a little messy because I lot of this is finger food but nothing too bad The guac pasta salad was delicious I only wish I got more of it Both times I visited I got an outdoor seat which was lovely The only downside is that there is a lot of traffic and the outdoor dining area is shared with a parking lot but then again there is not a lot of space in general A lot of college students from Virginia tech come here to eat and it seems that many of the servers are tech students Heard of this place when I first got here and had to try it out It does not disappoint! Also they serve complimentary chips and corn salsa and it\&#39;s good!! I don\&#39;t understand why this place has 4 stars I guess these reviwers drank gasoline or something beforehand The corn and salsa dip can easily be made at home and is at best mediocre The chips were great The fish tacos I had (tuna /tuna) were like puke being stuffed into my mouth Yes I scarfed them down but not because they were good I was afraid if I took a second to really taste what I was eating I would puke it back up The service on the other hand was great That was the main reason why I didn\&#39;t complain She was so nice and cute so I decided to just suffer through it It was honestly a big waste of money 4 stars for the service 1 star for the food Cabo is still my favorite go-to place in Blacksburg for something light healthy and affordable I had the Soy Ginger Shrimp taco this timeI absolutely loved the crispy shrimp glazed with a sweet sauce The cabbage inside the tacos gave it a nice crunch and also gave them some color The tortilla was also warm and crisp It doesn\&#39;t matter how many of chips and salsa I had prior to the meal (every table gets a complementary appetizer) I don\&#39;t feel bloated after eating the tacos You really can\&#39;t go wrong with any of the tacos here I\&#39;ve never left Cabo Fish Taco unsatisfied! Good food good service If you are in Blacksburg this is one of the places you should check out They have good collection of drinks as well! Pretty good place Service was good and decent draft beer offerings Free chips and salsa was nice Really enjoyed my tuna taco with a side of guacamole salad Typical college town type spot Nothing too special as far as atmosphere Will go back to try some of the other tacos Just thinking about Cabo makes my mouth waterEvery time I visit Blacksburg I go to Cabo And pretty much every time I go to Cabo I order the same thing: Buffalo Shrimp tacos and an El Cheapo margarita The shrimp tacos are spicy and satisfying and the El Cheapo (made with a combination of orange and lime juices) is only $4 With the tacos you also get the choice of one side I generally get the jalapeno mashers but like to try the rotating special sides tooSome of my happiest memories in college involve sitting on the patio at Cabo eating the chips and corn salsa that come with the meal and sipping margaritas You cannot beat the experience that Cabo provides ***I should note that the first time I ate at Cabo it was after a decent amount of protest I insisted that I didn\&#39;t like fish tacos so I wouldn\&#39;t like Cabo I was wrong on both counts - it turns out that I do in fact like fish tacos (after giving them a try at Cabo) But even if I hadn\&#39;t there are plenty of delicious meals on the menu that don\&#39;t involve fish! Awesome food! Love the Halibut tacos! Place gets a bit crowded during lunch so come early Will definitely be back We found this place via Yelp during a visit to Blacksburg and it did not disappoint! Wonderful ambience very friendly and laid-back service The tacos were delicious We sampled several including the specials This place gets 2 stars! Off the top I was taken back that house margarita frozen cost more than one on the rocks To have my drink brought over &amp; it\&#39;s all minced ice chunks &amp; watered down margarita! Gross!! Sweet waitress doesn\&#39;t multitask well She seemed overwhelmed &amp; I felt bad for her The restaurant didn\&#39;t look prepared for the crowd they received My food was super late; some friends of mine came in after me &amp; got their food 20minskeep in mind we were already waiting a while already I\&#39;ll spare you the details of the texture &amp; taste of my food just know that it was not great Overall I wasn\&#39;t impressed nor will I return This place always has good taco deals tasty food the service is decent and beer and mixed drink selection is good Two huge pluses for us are that the kids like it and we always love to have theoption for indoor or outdoor seating Okay starting out amazing atmosphere great location! My server Lexi was awesome! Lexi made great recommendations and was very patient as I went back and forth on what I should try Settled on 2 x specialty tacos 1 Salmon &amp; 1 Tuna w/wasabi sauce Tacos were pretty amazing! Salsa was pretty good too although I wasn\&#39;t a huge fan of the chips Only downside for me was I thought it was just a little pricey But NOT over the top Blacksburg was just a quick stop over on my way to another destination Would definitely come back to this little gem of a Taco place! Being from out of town we were directed to try this place I was very happy The ambience was nice the service was phenomenal and the food was greatThe food is rather simple but it was delicious fresh and very flavorful I would certainly return if I were in the area again! I split the tavarau tuna tacos and the Mahi Mahi tacos with my coworker and enjoyed them both I would highly recommend the tuna tacos They bordered being a little too sweet for my taste with the honey wasabi sauce but the tuna was cooked perfectly and the homemade flour tortillas are on point Favorite restaurant in Blacksburg Can\&#39;t get fish tacos like these anywhere else (Man I miss college and Cabo) Loveeee their chips and salsa too And love the Beachy vibes of the restaurant I don\&#39;t know a single person who doesn\&#39;t love Cabo From the salsa they bring out when you first sit down to the tacos to the margs and everything else in between Their margaritas are great because they don\&#39;t taste as sugary and syrupy as other margarita mixes and they have a large selection They also have every brand of tequila known to man You can\&#39;t go wrong with their tacos I personally love the grilled serrano chicken but I\&#39;ve tried others and they\&#39;re delicious too There\&#39;s just something about the white sauce they put on top All of the sides are great but the jalapeo mashers are definitely the crowd pleaser I\&#39;ve eaten here more times than I can remember and it\&#39;s just as amazing every time I go back I really wish I could find one closer to me since I no longer live in Blacksburg and can only eat there when I visit (shoutout to Nova - can we get a Cabo up here?) But I go back every time no matter what the wait time is I\&#39;m always pleased when we go to Cabo It\&#39;s easy good food and great Margaritas! The Gold Coast (I think that\&#39;s what it\&#39;s called) is my favorite We love sitting outside on a beautiful summer night Cabo fish taco has always been one of my favorite restaurants in Blacksburg I love the ahi tuna tacos and bbq Mahi Mahi tacos but some of the other options on the menu could be spiced up (I love spicy food so it\&#39;s a personal thing) Best Margs in town!! Stopped here because I used to frequent their Charlotte location and was excited to see the original I was alone so I went to the bar The bartender literally rolled his eyes when I sat down as he dropped a menu in front of me A couple sat at the bar a few minutes later (there was no one else at the bar other than me) The bartender started talking to them and stayed there until I left about 5-7 minutes later I love the food at Cabo in Charlotte but the service here is horrible If you want some really good food go to The Black Hen &amp; Bar Blue The lamb chops are AMAZING! Not a big fan of Cabo Fish Taco I\&#39;ve been there twice and really just didn\&#39;t enjoy what I was served either time With that being said however their staff is very friendly and their location is very nice; especially if you\&#39;re able to sit outside Great atmosphere delicious options cheap margaritas and the wait is never as long as they say it will be Love Cabo! Service is just okay the tacos are great but sometimes come out cold I think there shouldbe a few more drinks on the menu that are less pricy Amazing Maui tacos I look forward to coming to VT every year just because I get to eat here It\&#39;s a must have when in the area Love this place My favorite place to visit when I come back to the burg!!Soy ginger shrimp tacos will never let you down! I really enjoyed my meal here this weekend! The restaurant was packed but worth the wait time The service was good so good in fact the waitress informed us our orders were messed up in the kitchen but had free queso in hand to make up for it I had the lemon grilled shrimp tacos and a jumbo el cheapo margarita The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the toppings and tortillas were delicious The margarita was a little sweet for my taste but still very good very big and the price was right! ($8!) My only complaint was the rice I had gotten on the side It was topped with something sweet which made it gross But it\&#39;s still one of my favorite restaurants in Blacksburg! My coworkers and I absolutely love Cabo! Everything is great - I personally love the soy ginger shrimp tacos Yum! The staff is always friendly :) Cabo Fish Taco is one of my absolute favorite places to eat down in Blacksburg I went there often with my friends during my undergrad years and I always try to eat there at least once when I go down to visit Appetizers: The complimentary chips and salsa they give you are very good The salsa has chunks of corn tomatoes and cilantro It\&#39;s very fresh and flavorful and we usually finish the whole thing before our food comes out! Their Baja Shrimp and Crab Dip is THE bomb At first you can\&#39;t really see the shrimp and crab but once you bite into it you can definitely tastes the chunks The pita slices that come with it is so warm chewy and just a perfect compliment to the dip The Spinach and Artichoke Dip is also very delicious This was my favorite appetizer at Cabo until I tried the Shrimp and Crab Dip Their Crispy Calamari is also quite good and doesn\&#39;t have that I guess &#34;fishy&#34; taste calamari from other places have but I think I would choose one of the dips over this Salads: The Diablo Shrimp Salad is very fresh and the portion size is HUGE The shrimp are jumbo sized and super plump My mom and sister took one bite of mine and then kept coming back for more During my most recent visit I ordered the Sweet Blackened Tuna Salad but they had run out of sashimi style tuna so my tuna was cooked well done Although I was a bit disappointed I couldn\&#39;t get the sashimi tuna the salad was still very delicious Their mango-pineapple chutney is also very fresh and flavorful My mom loves it over her rice Tacos: I usually get the BBQ Mahi Tacos which are so delicious This was what I got when I went to Cabo for the first time and it was the reason why I fell in love with the place Cabo definitely does not skimp on the huge chunks of fish they put in the taco and all the ingredients are so fresh and flavorful My mom is usually very picky about food and she didn\&#39;t really want to go to Cabo when I first brought it up After one bite of this taco she also fell in love with the place and we\&#39;ve been back about 3 times together since I also usually get the baja rice as my side which is rice with their mango-pineapple chutney over it The mango-pineapple is very fresh and adds a very refreshing splash to the rice The Bar:They have a nice selection of beer but I usually get their Original Caborita Margarita You can definitely taste the tequila and it isn\&#39;t too too sweet which I love Overall the service is great the food is awesome and the drinks are super yummy They also have outdoor patio seating I definitely recommend giving this place a try! I love this place! I decided to branch out of my comfort zone as I am not a fan of seafood and my friend was visiting and wanted to come here It was SO good I got the blackened mahi tacos and she got the chicken tacos and the calamari tacos Calamari and mahi was delicious and chicken was pretty good as well Their avocado pasta salad is great as a side Keep in mind I am not a fan of seafood so for me to say both types were delicious is a pretty big deal! I love cabo and will keep coming here as long as I\&#39;m in school Had the Mahi BBQ with mashed potatoesAbsolutely delectable! Total package in terms of tortilla and fish with the BBQ sauce to top it off My mouth waters just thinking about itCame back the next day for lunch getting the Tavarua Tuna with the baja rice Again the tacos were exceptional The rice was pedestrian especially compared to the flavor punch of the Wasabi from the Tuna tacosService also great Friendly and helpful staff Really cool spot to check out in Va Tech territory! I love this place It is hands down one of the best restaurants in Blacksburg I have probably gone here the most throughout my whole undergrad career and when I come back to visit my friends and boyfriend I always have stop by! Everything is always fresh so don\&#39;t get mad if their menu changes or they run out of something - that\&#39;s when you know they\&#39;re the real deal! If you want to get drinks I\&#39;d suggest their mojitos (again my favorite) or their silver surfer margarita (classic margarita taste but they never get it wrong)! They also have a full bar with a large selection of beers but I don\&#39;t drink beer usually so I can\&#39;t really give any advice on that! To start their complementary fresh chips and corn/tomato salsa are delicious Every time I go my waiter/waitress has had to refill at LEAST once :P If you\&#39;re looking for another appetizer the spinach-artichoke dip is incredible! They serve it with fried pita wedges which are amazing Now to get to the main stars the tacos! Definitely do not miss out on trying the soy ginger shrimp tacos Like I\&#39;ve said in other reviews shrimp\&#39;s not my favorite but these are lightly fried in a delicious batter and then glazed with the soy ginger sauce This combination with the fresh cabbage is just happiness in your mouth The BBQ Mahi tacos are also something you should not miss out on trying! Since I\&#39;ve eaten here so much I\&#39;ve tried all the tacos and these two are the best My most recent favorite were the soft shell crab tacos but it was a special just for that day and the next time I came back they weren\&#39;t serving them! Sad day If you\&#39;re looking for advice on their sides the jalapeno cheddar mashers black beans and rice and the baja rice are the best ones However they have most recently changed the recipe for the jalapeno cheddar mashers and I do not love them as much as I did before They now dice up pickled jalapeno and add them to what are now just called &#34;herb mashers&#34; if you want jalapeno Definitely changes the flavor and isn\&#39;t as good as it used to be Other than this recent change I am still in love with Cabo Fish Taco! Go! had to wait an hour but passed the time in the bar enjoying the ranger ipa we were seated and were served delicious light perfectly seasoned tortilla chips then had the spicy tuna taco special which was delicious wife had the shrimp tacos which also looked great Not a 4-star restaurant but the tacos earn it The soy ginger shrimp tacos and the garlic buffalo shrimp are the class of the group Curiously the soy ginger shrimp taste of neither But they are delicious Make of that what you will Loved this place Attended over winter break with 6 people including 3 kids and a grandmother Local students were at the bar watching hoops  Menu was awesome but all of the fish tacos tasted surprising similar Thumbs up Love the restaurant Everything I have tried was do good  The service was also great friendly and fast Great place to eat I ate here a few months back and had the shrimp tacos and they were absolutely delicious The salads and chips were great too Unfortunately I don\&#39;t have any upcoming trips to the area! My wife and I enjoyed a meal here while traveling through Blacksburg We were very impressed with our entrees and appetizer There was an impressive amount of attention paid to the small details  the sides sauces etc were all very good Service was quick and attentive Overall highly recommended! It was my first visit to Blacksburg and my younger sister (recent grad and reason for my visit) said we will be coming here for lunch Even with it being graduation weekend we managed to get here early enough and my 9-person family was seated immediately The service was excellent-- informative and attentiveThe corn salsa and the shrimp &amp; crab dip were awesome and immediately brought me back to my visit to the Charlotte location last year Both items were superb For my entree I ordered the BBQ Mahi Tacos with the Jalapeno Cheddar Mashers Like my Charlotte visit I loved the tacos I ordered Also like my Charlotte visit I was underwhelmed with my side The mashers had a great spice but were dense lukewarm and lacking seasoning One of my sisters ordered the Tavarua Tuna Tacos also with the Jalapeno Cheddar Mashers as the side and she agreed with my underwhelming sentiment but thought the tacos were excellent The Baja Chicken Bowl my other sister ordered was large and had a unique presentation It had good flavor but the chicken was a little dry My mom ordered the seasonal veggies with her Blackened Mahi Tacos and seemed to enjoy both So in my personal opinion a couple of the side items need some improvement (I ordered the Baja Rice at the Charlotte location and also wasn\&#39;t impressed) With that said it was an overall enjoyable meal and great visit I would come here any day of the week for the delicious taco options I highly recommend trying the Shrimp &amp; Crab dip if you come here Quick reviewCame here while visiting friends at VTech It was lunch time on a Friday so it wasn\&#39;t busy I didn\&#39;t explore the entire restaurant but it looked like a chill place for the night crowd I enjoyed the BBQ Mahi tacos with the blacks beans and rice Will definitely eat here again the next time i\&#39;m in town! Agh This place should not have a 4 star rating  Maybe 3 but surely not 4! The artichoke and spinach dip is kinda bland and is missing something It tasted more like melted cream cheese with sprinkles of artichoke and spinach The pita chips that are served with the dip are fried unnecessarily and topped with cheese At $850 it is an overpriced appetizer The bbq fish taco basically could be bbq chicken/beef/tofu because you wouldn\&#39;t know the difference since the bbq sauce over powers the fish I guess this food is best eaten when drinking since anything tastes good in that state This is nothing like the fish tacos in California so don\&#39;t expect delicious fish tacos - rather passable food Great atmosphere friendly waitstaff and delicious food If you have to wait during the dinner rush it\&#39;s well worth the wait Great for family dinners and date nights! A return visit to Cabo proved to be as good as the first Delicious food prepared fresh served promptly and savored on the patio on a lazy Tuesday afternoon was a lovely way to end a day of errands and shopping I had the daily special: lemon mahi tacos and selected as always the garlic mashed potatoes as a side Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! The drink menu while extensive and tempting I\&#39;m saving for a future visit with friends Tasty fresh tacos with ingredients that are clearly house made/prepared The margaritas were pretty solid as well Service was great Food came up quick and server was friendly and attentive While my wife and I only had tacos the other food coming out looked delicious as well The sides weren\&#39;t bad but could have been better Sides we had were guacamole pasta salad rice and beans and mexi-slaw They all seemed to lack the flavor that wants me make more but that was honestly the only low point but for the price still 5 stars Great atmosphere friendly staff and consistent delivery of their drinks apps and entreeThe honey wasabi tuna burrito and &#34;fejitas&#34; are my go to and quality and consistency are always on pointSpring/Summer sitting outside is the way to go Had lunch on Cabo on Friday Cool place and good food Wait staff was very friendly  and helpful Anyone who thinks this place is &#34;good&#34; is probably from VA and wouldn\&#39;t know good Mexican food if it slapped them in the face I\&#39;ve never had any kind of taco served on a single taco shell before aside from Taco Bell Their food is comparable although slightly more exotic I suppose  Good atmosphere but not the kind of food you\&#39;d get at a normal &#34;traditional&#34; taqueria Blah Three stars because service is fine it\&#39;s decently clean has outdoor seating I realize that this is a FISH taco place but still wanted to review to comment on their vegetarian offerings Most of it is palatable but not really anything special I was psyched when they introduced beer-battered tofu tacos But sadly they were even more flavorless than plain tofu I\&#39;ve mostly been here with my sister who loves this place Not a horrible option for vegetarians but not all that exciting either Meh Not horrible but overrated by my fellow yelpers Too bready and greasy on any of the breaded fish or shrimp Mexislaw is bad Queso is ok Salty salty chips This place hands down is one of the best establishments to go to in Blacksburg! If you\&#39;re craving some seafood tacos or regular upscale tacos this is the place for youAs a student I didn\&#39;t come here much as it was a bit pricier than other restaurants on my college budget but as an alumni it\&#39;s fantastic! It might seem a bit pricey at first compared to the sports bars etc but it\&#39;s well worth the priceThis is definitely more upscale than your typical college bar and the prices definitely reflect it but so does the quality You always get some complementary chips and dip to start off the meal They have some killer dips followed by some tasty tacos that really hit the spot I\&#39;ve had the Soy Ginger Shrimp Tacos and the Tuna Tacos and they were both flavorfuk and juicy As far as the dips go you have to get the Baja Shrimp and Crab Dip! It\&#39;s one of the best items on the menu and always a crowd pleaser you won\&#39;t be disappointedAnd they obviously have booze beers tequila and of course margaritas! The margaritas come in so many flavors that it can be hard to choose which one but all are great tasting! My only complaint is that they give you a little more off during happy hour but that being said they\&#39;re still a good valueService here is always good better than most bars in the area so that\&#39;s a nice plus The wait staff is always friendly no complaints ever Fantastic tacos! Definitely try the soy ginger shrimp You can also mix and match taco styles Food was ok I just couldn\&#39;t get past paying $30 for a tea and four tacos Very expensive for what you get The Cole slaw was not cold and the battered white fish had so much breaking in it you couldn\&#39;t taste the fish Husbands beef tacos were tasty but seriously not for $6 a taco Went there for Taco Tuesday with $200 tacos and some drinks Had a great time and the server put up with the rowdiness of my group The tacos were good but I wouldn\&#39;t go on a day when they are their normal price of over $6 for a small taco Love the soy ginger shrimp (Best taco on the menu imo) and their happy hour and specials aren\&#39;t that bad either I go here pretty much a couple times a semester over the course of going to VT Food price could be a bit cheaper since apps and a main will cost you an average of $20+ Good food great price/value good selection of craft beers and very prompt and friendly service Highly recommend the Buffalo Shrimp Tacos not so much on the Blackened Tuna Tacos Still worth the stop Oh Cabo - one of my go-to spots when I was living in Blacksburg Reasonably priced food (especially for a college kid) that\&#39;s unique in its own right among the other dining establishments in Blacksburg I\&#39;m a fan of the BBQ/blackened mahi-mahi tacos and the beer-battered fish tacos (you get two tacos per order but keep in mind that you can order two different tacos!); the shrimp and chicken burrito is also a good choice They\&#39;ll start you off with a delicious corn/tomato salsa with crispy tortilla chips (I miss that so much!) and their margaritas are pretty solidService is very friendly and casual (as it should be for a beach-ish shack in the middle of downtown Blacksburg) They have indoor and outdoor seating as well as a pool table upstairs Check out this place next time you\&#39;re in Blacksburg! Pros:- Great service- Amazing food (*Fish tacos are amazing)- Great drinks- Atmosphere fits the food they serve- Endless chips &amp; SalsaCons:- No reservations (Understandable) Cabo Fish Taco is a cosy place great for dinner with a date or a group of friends The ambience is simple yet uniqueThe food is excellent although vegetarian options are limited It\&#39;s a little bit on the &#34;expensive-ish&#34; side for a restaurant in a student town All in all great place! After telling us it would be at least a 90 minute wait  Big football weekend plus a free brad paisley concert! We left our phone number and downloaded the waiting time app and they texted after 45 minutes that our table was ready Sat outside on their brick patio on a beautiful night and enjoyed the queso dip ginger soy shrimp tacos and white fish tacos Quick service  very reasonable prices and really good food great casual dining ! Very convenient to campus Several trips here across seasons (essentially with students and without) have not disappointed The drinks are ok with good selection but food is real draw In most recent visit our group sampled wide selection including guac queso artichoke dip fish tacos fajitas bufallo shrimp tacos baja bowl and everything was excellent Service was ok when bustling very good when less crowded Having gone to the Charlotte location of Cabo and fallen head over heels for their delicious seafood taco creations I had to give the Blacksburg version a try on my trip up there recently to visit my long-time friendThe exact same menu as the one in Charlotte I couldn\&#39;t stray away from ordering one of their specialty seafood tacos mostly because of how delicious I had remembered it being in the Queen City My friend advised me to get his favorite option the soy ginger shrimp tacos assuring me that they are a life changing experience Quite a tall claimI don\&#39;t know if my life was changed but I do know that the tacos were darn tasty The slightly crispy shrimp were complemented by the soy ginger glaze and slaw and topped with avocado tomato and cheese all resting inside of two flour tortillasThere is an extensive choice of sides to pick from and I wanted to get something different from what I ordered in Charlotte for comparisons sake but couldn\&#39;t bring myself not to order the jalapeno-cheddar mashed potatoes Cheese Mashed potatoes Spicy How can you say no? Trust me it\&#39;s awesome My sister got the fajita burrito and my cousin ordered a seafood pasta both of which looked really good but if I went back I would keep checking a new specialty taco off my list before I ventured on to the rest of the menu Such a classic spot for Blacksburg When I look back on my years in Blacksburg Cabo will always have a special spot in my heart that I will missAll of the tacos on the menu are made fresh and are absolutely delicious The beer battered white fish tacos have such a great batter and the cilantro white sauce is so delicious with the flavorful fish and the crunchy slaw I love the seasonal sides they offer too! Sometimes I just crave Cabo and impulsively drag someone to go with meA great restaurant that is sure to satisfy anyone that come here! I haven\&#39;t visited Blacksburg in about 10 years and a former fellow alum recommended Cabo Luckily I like him for reasons other than his food recommendations because this place is mediocre at best When I go to a Mexican restaurant I want chips and salsa Not chips and corn When I order guacamole I want mashed avocado with onion cilantro lime juice and salt Not some sort of whipped avocado concoction that I really should have had taken back but was too hungry to argue over The only way this could have had less flavor is ifwell there\&#39;s really no way actually It just isn\&#39;t worth the money I had the lemon shrimp tacos and they are the only reason I rate this place as a 2 They were delicious My fiance had the soy ginger tacos and said they were tasty The black beans and rice must have been seasoned by the same worker who seasoned the avocado puree Bland as turkey on white bread The only way I\&#39;d go back is if the tacos can be ordered a la carte Cabo Fish Taco is my #1 go-to in Blacksburg They have so many interesting dishes on the menu! My favorite (by far) is the Soy Ginger Shrimp Tacos Everything is flavorful and the ingredients are super fresh I would highly recommend it! So much better than a traditional Mexican restaurant The garlic buffalo shrimp tacos are killer The margarita choices are endless and with each new one I find a favorite The restaurant is a little dark but that is easy to forget with the great meal! Delicious foodA bit expensive for what they serveQuality of appetizers are inconsistent Limited parking space I\&#39;m not sure why this is the second highest rated restaurant in Blacksburg The food here is below average &#34;Corn&#34; salsa is just corn with tomato and the carne Asada tacos were nothing special The &#34;cheese&#34; they put on the tacos looked and tasted like store bought Parmesan cheese Honestly save your money and your belly and just go to ChipotleAmbiance and service is great But if you\&#39;re going to be an independent restaurant you gotta deliver tasty food with unique flavors This place does not deliver Best restaurant in Blacksburg Everything is amazing Start with the queso dip then get any of the fish tacos or the soy ginger shrimp tacos Pro move if you get one of each So good! Like others said the soy ginger tacos and the jalapeo cheddar mashed potatoes Yum! Very friendly service and reasonable prices The best of Blacksburg! Virginia Tech has the #1 food in the nation and that trend flows right across Main Street to Cabo Your dinner starts with a great corn/ salsa mix and chops but there are several great appetizers to choose from as well All of the tacos have great flavor with fresh ingredients They have several different specials every night that keep you from ordering the same dish over and over A few sides to choose from to accompany your tacos the jalapeo mashers are my personal favorite Can\&#39;t go wrong with this place! this is the best restaurant i\&#39;ve been to in Blacksburg it\&#39;s unique and creative and not one you\&#39;ll forget the pitas are a must they are sooooo good pair them with the spinach &amp; artichoke dip also try the cheddar mashers or the guacamole pasta salad the beans are rice are bland but this place is bomb After my fourth time here I decided to write a review Whether with kids or rowdy friends this place doesn\&#39;t disappoint Food is fresh and on the spicy side which I enjoy Drinks are always good and VERY reasonably priced (gotta love drinking in a college town!) we did have to send our mojitos back (way to much simple syrup) but they gladly replaced them for something else within minutes Nice warm atmosphere which is awesome after chilly football games Service has been great every time The crowd is an awesome mix of alumni and students alike so there\&#39;s no worries about feeling old here! Cheers! The food here is better than you would expect in a college town The seafood items are of good quality and prepared in a tasty way The specials are unique Fantastic service and atmosphere Tyler was our server and he was GREAT We told him what we liked and he found us the perfect craft beer Food was wonderful especially the lemon-pepper grilled tuna tacos Will be back! And thank you Tyler - you\&#39;re an asset to Cabo I visited Cabo Fish Taco after hearing rave reviews from some of my Hokie friends The food was good and the service was quick and friendly Although I do not like seafood there were plenty of options and I ended up getting a steak burrito with a side of cheesy jalapeo mashers (aka mashed potatoes with jalapeos and cheese) My friends got fish tacos and loved every bite There is definitely room for improvement in the queso and salsa department but other than that no complaints! I love cabo Depending how busy it is they will not fry the calamari for the tacos When it\&#39;s a slower day usually during the week I will get the calamari taco If it\&#39;s the weekend I will get a taco with a different kind of fish Their food is amazing The only downside to this place is the wait on busy nights This is my go-to place in Blacksburg I\&#39;ve probably been here 20+ times while at Tech and love everything about it The servers are all chill but they also take good care of you and I like that when they\&#39;re busy you can head over to Starbucks and get something to drink while you wait or get something at the bar The queso and the guac are great and are cheap as compared to other places but their complimentary salsa is the bomb by itself I used to get a BBQ mahi taco and a lemon grilled shrimp taco but the soy ginger shrimp taco changed my life The baja rice is also where it\&#39;s at My friends love the jalapeno cheddar mashers but it\&#39;s a little too spicy for me so I stay with the rice Definitely recommend to anyone coming into town to visit or go to a game it\&#39;s worth the wait Friday night dinner party of 4 - 45 minute wait VERY WORTH THE WAIT! We roamed around the shops until they called us - loved that pager service The chips and corn salsa were good Highly recommend the Soy Ginger Shrimp tacos amazing! Great service too! Dine outside if you want to have conversation inside was lively Best Tacos Ever!I crave their garlic buffalo shrimp tacos every other week! So good and it has a great kick to it too! Also their sides are always unique and quite good Super Americanized Mexican food but definitely worth trying if you\&#39;re in the area We had great service particularly attentive to our kids We really appreciate that And the food came out fast  However the food was nothing to right home about The beer battered fish tacos I had were almost flavorless The avocado that was supposed to be present was non-existent and they laid the fish on a bed of cheddar cheese Who does that to a fish taco? Lastly the kids meals were supposed to come with fresh fruit but instead came with canned pineapplenot exactly fresh  To conclude great service but mediocre food Wait time was a little leas than the 30 minutes we were told in a Friday night ( before a game) but it was so worth it Quick friendly servicemeal recommendation of Soy Ginger shrimp was perfect An absolute favorite spot in blacksburg! BBQ mahi tacos and the avocado pasta salad are my go-to and never fail to satisfy :) I get carry out and dine in pretty equally and both are great Cabo is mostly a hit If you can sit outside it\&#39;s a winner every time Margarita\&#39;s are a hit high or low end and most things on their menu are just delicious However on this last visit I was very disappointed in the changes to the Jalapeo Cheddar Mashers These used to be one of the reasons I craved Cabo and this time I we all left them in the dish Bring back the original seasoning and you bring back some fans! My absolute FAVORITE place to eat in all of Blacksburg It\&#39;s pretty much a crime to not stop by and get the ginger soy shrimp tacos with pasta salad on the side if you\&#39;re in town I crave this food in my sleep Seriously though I can\&#39;t give this place enough stars If you don\&#39;t have time to order in just call ahead for pickup and they\&#39;ll have your food ready at the bar in ten minutes or less! Possibly my favorite food in all the world actually Great service too! You won\&#39;t be disappointed ----UPDATE: Jan 15 2011As promised we gave Cabo its second chance Drum rollThis time we were joined by some of our awesome friends And from last time\&#39;s experience we weren\&#39;t expecting a lot Well we were definitely proven wrong Cabo fired back with authorityFor starters our friend Kat had gotten the Veggie Roll and was kind enough to let me taste it One word: Glorious It is portabella and wild mushrooms yellow squash zucchini and the usual works It was presented in sushi style (bigger portions) topped with tequila lime aioli This was also served with salad on the side I had requested to have a sample of their Soy Ginger Shrimp Taco and the Tavarua Tuna Taco The soy ginger taco came with beer battered shrimps that were tossed in a soy ginger glaze stuffed with cabbage tomato avocado monterey jack and cheddar cheese topped altogether with sesame seeds to taste The shrimp were juicy and plump; tasty and savory good The Tavarua Tuna Taco was delightfully fresh; definitely not dry this time around You can taste all the ingredients well and how they complemented each other on your palate To pair I had a glass of their sparkling potable Cabo water The Lover is not as adventurous and as random as I am He ordered the Carne Asada Steak Burrito again This time it was not disappointing for he devoured that thing in 2 minutes --- the whole thing! Good? I\&#39;d say it was a lot better than the first one (Beer pairing to be posted soon The Lover isn\&#39;t here and I can\&#39;t remember for the life of me what it was he drank that night) The tortillas were fresh And like last time the masher was AMAZINGSo overall Cabo has proven to be a respected taco joint in our book We can\&#39;t wait to try more from their menu and maybe even try the bar atmosphere next time Give me a chance! The food here is great Probably the best Baja-style Mexican food in the county Even the drinks are adequate The problem is the service Cabo Fish Taco over and over again has the slowest service in town It doesn\&#39;t matter how many people are being served do not expect more than two drinks per three-hour meal I have been here over seven times in the past 18 months due to the food but we always leave frustrated due to the poor serviceIf you want to have a one drink one menu item lunch meal this is a great way to spend your lunch hour If you want to even add a water to your bill however be sure you have an additional 45 minutes to spareThe staff are friendly just not forward-thinking The building facilities are not that clean or accessible Cabo Fish Taco knows that they have caught their corner of the market and are doing nothing to exceed the expectationPrices are on the upper end for Blacksburg (so well below other towns) but are appropriate considering the high-quality of the food5 stars if I were only rating the quality of food/drink 1 star if I rate any other category beside food/drink I now only visit when I have people from out of town who may of heard of this establishment No other place in town can beat their taco but if you want anything else visit one of the many other Mexican choices in the local area Delicious food and surprisingly lots of options The outside seating is a plus and the beer battered white fish tacos were to die for! Loved it! Gotta say I travel all over the world and when I am in Blacksburg VA this is the only place to eat Not many places I like eating alone but these guys do it right  Service is terrific and the food is &#34;just right&#34; Lots of great flavors with the tacos and the supporting cast of apps and sides are just as good If you are visiting Virginia Tech make sure to stop by! Good food but consistently get poor service  I love their fish tacos but we have gone as a group with friends of mine and the three times we have tried to have a night out we received terrible service The manager had to be called at one outing Probably won\&#39;t return at least with a larger group Not a a place to go with a group for drinks that\&#39;s for sure Tacos were great! Free chips and salsa was a nice perk but the chips were a lil stale The limeade was really good and not super sweet Service is usually good but sometimes a little unenthusiastic Overall prices are a tad high but the food is great with unique flavor combinations Went here while visiting Blacksburg Found out that the Charlotte location was featured on Triple D so had to try it out Atmosphere was great and the vibe was exactly right Had the Mango BBQ Mahi Taco\&#39;s and my girlfriend had the Steak Fajitas Absolutely great food Fresh and fast Server could have been a bit more attentive but we were in no rush and enjoying ourselves so it wasn\&#39;t a big deal at all Definitely a place to try if your looking for something different Really great margaritas and specials too This place is always a stop when I\&#39;m in Blacksburg! I have never had a taco like the soy ginger shrimp ones And the workman\&#39;s margarita is always a must! I\&#39;ve never had a bad experience here By far one of my favorite places to eat in Blacksburg! They have delicious food; I personally recommend the soy ginger shrimp tacos Grab a table outside and enjoy some friendly service awesome food and well made drinks! Always delicious and fast A great place to hang at night that also has awesome and creative food I eat here every time I\&#39;m in town BBQ Mahi tacos are a must Great as always Super tacos and burritos Buffalo shrimp tacos are spicy Crab dip was very good The best ever Period Everything is delicious I could eat their crab dip for the rest of my life Ginger shrimp tacos are my favorite but they\&#39;re all good They have salads and stuff if you don\&#39;t want the seafood Their margaritas are cheap You must go here or you haven\&#39;t lived the Blacksburg life They have pretty good drink deals each night so check them out One of my favorite places to eat in Blacksburg A great place to get away from all the college bars I\&#39;ve tried a few of the tacos and they have all been been great I would check out the specials for the day I\&#39;m torn about this place The margaritas are excellent as long as Brian didn\&#39;t make it (he isn\&#39;t there anymore) The corn salsa they give with the chips is really good I usually go with a seafood option and the filling is good but frying the tortilla just makes it oily - yuck I can\&#39;t go 35 so I\&#39;ll round up based on the normally excellent service Great carne asada tacos fried shrimp tacos guacamole pasta basically everything One of our favorite places I had the Garlic Buffalo Shrimp taco after my friend insistedmore like after my friend demanded that I ignore everything else on the menu but I was not disappointed An excellent first time experience Definitely worth it Everything I have had at this place is amazing From the crab dip to the any of the tacos (blacken mahi and ginger shrimp are my favs) to the Margaritas I crave this place Came here with high hopes that were quickly dashed the moment I walked into Cabo Not sure if there was a issue with the pipes that particular day but I walked in and the place literally smelled like a toilet I\&#39;m all for divey places but I can\&#39;t say that I\&#39;d go back here I had beer battered fish tacos which were bland as were the chips and salsa (as a side note I always find it mildly shocking when deep fried foods are blandever heard of salt?) My husband had shrimp tacos which were actually pretty good Still not enough for me to go back Overall great place Excellent food Excellent prices Some people like the Soy Ginger Shrimp tacos I have had both but prefer the Garlic Buffalo Shrimp tacos Much better if you can stand a little heat The way they prepare the shrimp; never had anything like it Corn salsa and chips are excellent Service is good Go there every time I am in town Highly recommended Minus one star for atmosphere; too much bar for me Just my opinion I go for the food Favorite spot in Blacksburg After some research and a highly scientific analysis I have confirmed that the Cabo Rolls have crack in them They become highly addicting over time and cause temporary insanity when you get the craving It was so good! So glad I went! Very fresh homemade tortillas and good sides too I had the mahi fish tacos and my girlfriend got the buffalo shrimp tacos and both were awesome The mojitos were very good as well Good atmosphere good food priced well we will be back for sure! My one complaint was the salsa just wasn\&#39;t a huge fan It\&#39;s basically corn tomatoes and onion diced up in a bowl it is free though Other than that its a great place to eat! Try it! Just went there wth my daughter as we were visiting VA TECH and I prepared myself and her for slow servicebased on the reviews I had read here WRONG!!!! Great service! Great food! The only reason for the 4 stars is because I was not a fan of the BBQ sauce on the fish tacos But the Ginger Soy Shrimp taco5 stars alll the waythrow some hot sauce and lime on it and man look out I had no problem with this place what so ever Stopped here while passing through town in the summer Service was prompt and polite Food was delicious Tried the BBQ Mahi Tacos and the wife had the Epic Tuna Burrito Both had a great (not too hot) heat to them Would definitely stop in again when in town Of the spots I have eaten in Blacksburg this is currently my top pick The wait wasn\&#39;t bad for a Saturday night the staff was super friendly the food was amazing and I snagged the recipe for the best margarita I have ever been able to replicate at home! Class act I\&#39;ve been coming here the past five years and never had a bad experience Great times great food great service A+ as always they should call this place cabo shrimp taco because all their shrimp tacos are wayyy better than their fish ones just get their shrimp tacos and sides dont waste your money on appetizers and such One of my usual spots in BlacksburgBest tequila bar in town! The workman\&#39;s margarita is my favorite Some of the fried tacos can be a little greasy at times They have changed their chicken burrito from already wrapped to wrap yourself which I don\&#39;t like The chips and salsa they bring are good One of the few places that brings corn salsa instead of tomato based salsa to tables I dearly miss Cabo!! Cabo is a great Blacksburg place to eat The tacos are the best Their drinks are out of this world If you go when it is warm be sure to try to sit out side and watch life on Main Street go by They are locally owned which is always a plus in my mind It means you get the best service and they are part of the community If you are in Blacksburg for any reason go by and take a look Garlic Buffalo Shrimp tacos with mexislaw and a Silver Surfer to sip on $27 with tip Can\&#39;t wait to get back to Blacksburg to devour these again Terrible food terrible restaurant!Even when I adjust my score for Blacksburg I hate this place Folks who like it here have probably never had a real fish taco before The food reminds me of my undergrad dining hall version of fish tacos and that was actually much better (it might\&#39;ve helped I\&#39;m from California)This place is too pricey for what it is and it\&#39;s not a lot You get a few small pieces of fish covered in an awful white sauce that despite being bland managed to hide the taste of the fish and not in a good way Not recommended Ate dinner at the bar while in town in business Great service and great food! The bartender was very helpful with suggestions and let me know I could mix my tacos I chose the BBQ Mahi and Tuna tacos Both were great! Came with a side of guacamole pasta salad which was also very good I slo had a top shelf margarita and draft beer for a total of $30 before tip Plenty to eat! Not overly impressive with dishes that don\&#39;t call me back for more It was a trendy place to dine at first but has fallen off the grid the last few times we\&#39;ve been trying to decide where to dine The decor is not my taste and the bathrooms are odd I liked Cabogood times with friends I have definitely had better fish tacos in Europe Dang ! This place is great! Tried the ginger soy shrimp tacos Boss We had the queso dip too! Super Fried zucchini as a side dish Mexican beers on tapwhat\&#39;s not to like?? Seriously try this place Massive Bob Marley poster too ! Very reasonable prices 45 stars if I could rate it that way! Can\&#39;t wait to try it again I\&#39;m gonna bring the whole bowling team next time The Boring Brothers bowling bonanza Cabo is in a great location across from the VT Bookstore on Main Street While they are always busy service is fast and the food is generally pretty good The margaritas are also tasty (try the Pomerita or Purple Haze) We usually get the queso dip and chips for an appetizer and the shrimp and blackened mahi tacos The tacos could use less cabbage and more guacamole but the seafood is always perfectly cooked and plentiful I love the fact that they fry the flour tortillas - how unique is that?!  Getting a free side is also nice and my favorites are the jalapeno mashed potatoes and mexi-slaw with toasted pumpkin seedsWith their low prices we always go back and are never disappointed It\&#39;s funny that there is a second location in Charlotte (where we live) which we have never tried Somehow this just feels like a Blacksburg destination to us and we certainly don\&#39;t want to mess up that good feeling! I am currently eating the leftovers from my visit to Cabo this weekend I ordered the barbecue mahi-mahi taco with the &#34;Mexi-slaw&#34; on the side Mmmm I did not expect a Blacksburg restaurant to leave me so sated for so cheap! I am unsure of whether or not I could detect every interesting ingredient they have listed on their menu as part of my particular taco but I enjoyed it nonetheless I also really enjoyed the Mexi-slaw It was on the more dry side of &#34;slaw&#34; but I thought it was great and the pumpkin (?) seeds add a nice crunch My parents ordered the soy-ginger shrimp tacos and the serrano chicken salad and both were decently pleased My mom was quite disappointed with her side she had some kind of chutney-rice I believe She claimed it was &#34;sour&#34; Aside from that the atmosphere was pleasant chips were plentiful the homemade salsa was fresh and the service was attentive and friendly I can\&#39;t believe I waited so long to try this place; I will certainly be back to try the bar &amp; other menu items Oh Cabo I love you so It\&#39;s not enough that you make so many incredible and creative tacos that I don\&#39;t know how to choose or suggest the delicious evil that is a jalapeo margarita but you also hire servers that are kind fun and efficient Decided to check this place out since it was not looking too crowded on a Saturday afternoon They are doing some type of construction which made the parking even worse They should do like most Blacksburg businesses and just do away with any onsite parking This is a college town and the college crowd doesn\&#39;t require much in ambience The interior was a dive as expected The women\&#39;s rest room is upstairs in a teeny corner I am sure that experience gets interesting on the busy weekend nights The soy ginger shrimp taco with avocado pasta was delicious! My husband got a chicken taco and said it was average Cabo is the best place to eat in Blacksburg by far their food is amazing and the atmosphere is great They have an outdoor eating area for when it\&#39;s warm and they have a good selection of drinks including margaritas My favorite item on the menu is the BBQ Mahi Tacos with a side of Jalapeno Mashers YUM! Now I\&#39;ve heard I went at prime time (being during the week) but I really liked this place! I had the tuna taco which was little chunks of tuna steak done perfectly Cool atmosphere I\&#39;ve heard it can get annoyingly loud but it wasn\&#39;t when I was there I really enjoyed my dinner at Cabo Fish Taco I wish this place was around back when I was a Hokie! Cabo\&#39;s reviews on Yelp were a mixed back lots of 3/4 stars with the occasional 2 star thrown in there I have to say that we had a great dinning experience there I knocked off one star for two minor issues The frozen margarita that we got could have been a little tastier (but was loaded with booze) and the corn salsa was kind of weak Oh and we found that everything needed a few shakes from the salt shaker - which might be good for some of you low sodium peopleThe food was awesome though I got two tacos and mixed it up a little bit by getting one bbq mahi and one garlic buffalo shrimp The fish/shrimp tasted fresh fresh and the sauces were flavorful The jalepeno mashers live up to their reputation My fiance got the tuna burrito - kind of weird sounding but very tastyBlacksburg has needed a place like this for a long time Go! my dearest cabo fish tacoit\&#39;s been so long since i\&#39;ve last seen you how i miss your cheesy queso dip and funky chlorine-smelling lobby how i long to hear the crunch of your battered white fish tacos until we meet again &amp; eternally yoursclaire Yah this is the freshest and best-tasting Latin food in Blacksburg No question about it Baja feel tacos bowls and salads You also HAVE to try the crab dip It will change you forever! Love going to eat here! They have so many good tacos especially their daily specials Don\&#39;t be afraid to branch out to the fajitas salads or rasta pasta too though! Great margaritas and salsa as well You can\&#39;t go wrong here! Try to make a trip out when the patio is open and make the visit even more enjoyable! Great vibe Fantastic food Our server in training was friendly and made the experience divine Lots of drinks and specials Love! Great food Soy ginger honey wasabi and basic whitefish are all delicious A must try for anyone looking for something that is uniquely blacksburg Insane tequila selection as well Short wait at lunch Four of us tried 4 different entree\&#39; and the fried calamari appetizer Everything was excellent except the beans and rice Beans and rice was not very flavorful and the rice was kind of rubbery Other than that we will definitely try this place again when we\&#39;re in town again I used to work in the kitchen here so I\&#39;m a bit biased in my opinion I think the menu is great - it\&#39;s SoCal-influenced fare (NOT Mexican) and is unlike anything you can find in Blacksburg or anywhere nearby The fish tacos are delicious especially the BBQ Mahi tacos as are the tuna stacks and most of the burritos (Wasabi Tuna was my favorite while I was there) There\&#39;s only one caveat to the food I think: it depends on who prepares your food This is probably true with any restaurant in a college town but I\&#39;ve had some very good food here and some food that really let me down and I can always tell when it\&#39;s someone who likes to cook and does it well versus some schmuck just trying to make a dollar and doesn\&#39;t care about the end product The usual giveaway: the temperature and consistency of the taco shell It should be warm and crispy yet pliableAs far as the bar is concerned you\&#39;ll probably end up drinking with a number of regulars/locals/employees Cabo has the best margaritas in the area quality-wise (El Rodeo will give you the best bang for your buck with the Texas Jumbo Margarita) and if tequila is your thing you\&#39;ll be right at home Cabo offers every tequila available through the ABC in Virginia; last time I checked that was 72 different tequilas If you finish them all (over time) you\&#39;ll get your name on a plaque and maybe even a t-shirt or somethingParking can be a pain in the ass but there is a parking garage over in Kent Square if you need a spot You run the risk of being towed if you park at the Bookstore across the street All in all Cabo\&#39;s definitely a nice change of pace from the normal Blacksburg restaurant and bar I\&#39;d definitely recommend giving it a try Walking in the door of this place at 117 S Main was a flashback to 1978 when it was a nightclub by the same name! Looks about the same- except less sticky LOL The food was excellent as was the service Prices were reasonable Highly recommended The food here is perfect beyond belief The BBQ Mahi tacos are incredible rasta pasta and chicken fajitas are really amazing also If you need a drink they have a full bar and a good bar staff They also frequently have bands and DJs which makes for a fun timeTwo bad things I can say about this place:1 The parking is awful Too small but there are places to park within walking distance2 It\&#39;s busy and noisy It\&#39;s a college town and this is a popular place so that\&#39;s expectedEven with the 2 negative aspects I still give this place 5 stars If I could give 6 I would There are only two Cabo locations but check out the episode of Diners Drive-ins and Dives that features the Charlotte NC location It\&#39;s pretty cool Easily the largest Tequila selection in Blacksburg and maybe in Virginia We had the in house fried Tortilla Chips and Corn/Cilantro Salsa I recommend the Queso Dip too Working Man Margarita Salmon and Guacamole Salad with a vinaigrette dressing Blackened Mahi-Mahi soft tacos Most of the signature tacos come with two tacos and a side I got the re-fried beans Chocolate Lava Cake for dessert YUM The place has surf boards and twisted metal fish bone art on the walls and a relaxed college crowd and a staff to match I love this place the shrimp tacos they have here and the yummy margaritas I have to give it three stars though (which still means A-OK!) Their sides are AWFUL The only time I have enjoyed their sides is if they have a special of the day side that I tried I especially like the spicy grilled pineapple a side that I wish was permanently available but is only available once every month or two If cabo could get their sides up to the quality of their entrees and drinks they\&#39;d be the toast of the town My second review because I am now obsessed with getting Cabo for carry out It usually only takes them 15 minutes or less to get the food ready and I can pick it up on the way home from work for a relaxing evening with my boyfriend which is now my new favorite thing to do in Blacsburg HahaMy side note is this: I agree with everyone who says it depends on who cooks your food Last time I ordered there I couldn\&#39;t finish my second taco because the fish did not taste fresh and a twice my mashers were completely flavorless Other times its absolutely perfectmy favorite comfort food in this town!! :) Though it would please me if they\&#39;d figure out who the dumba$$ cook is who is messing up their food Best margaritas ever! Food is always great as I\&#39;ve tried a dozen different items off their menu and have never been disappointed Descent little taco joint All of there tacos are pretty authentic or as authentic as you can get in southwestern Virginia Can\&#39;t say I have just one favorite but the name sake fish tacos are a pretty safe bet Definitely the best patio drinking spot in Blacksburg Still cant get over the cheesy mashed potatoes as a side item I dont care if they do put jalapenos in them it\&#39;s still mashed potatoes at a taco placeweird As for the service just bring your own cooler of beer to the patio or be prepared to wait and wait and wait although the water did come out quick just not the beers or margaritas so part of that can be blamed on the bar staff Cabo has amazing food and nice ambience Perfect for when the parents come to visit! I definitely recommend getting their signature fish tacos (they\&#39;re two soft tacos btw) if you eat seafood There\&#39;s like 5 different options of different fishes and shrimps to choose from like Mahi Mahi Beer battered white fish And it comes with a side too All of the sides are really delicious but I get the baja rice because I like the sweet kick it has If you\&#39;re a vegetarian there are (kind of) two options for you One is a veggie burrito with a side pretty much like the signature fish tacos but just one tortilla instead of two tortillas The other is the exact same thing just with rice in it So if you\&#39;re not feeling too hungry go with the regular veggie burrito They\&#39;re delicious and cheaper than the fish tacos! Vegans can take off the cheese for these options!I wouldn\&#39;t recommend bringing a huge group here because the wait can be long and you can\&#39;t make reservations I\&#39;d say go to Bull and Bones for that Very hit or miss They need to change up the menu Only thing to get here are the tacos or salad The salsa is too much corn Stopped by for a quick lunch before a business meeting and it was &#34;ok&#34; Not disappointed but not impressed The food was decent but the servers weren\&#39;t the friendliest I\&#39;m not sure if it was because it was lunch and they weren\&#39;t too busy but I feel that the customer should always be treated with respect I didn\&#39;t feel too welcomed there and will more then likely not go back The server who\&#39;s name I will not release was very short and almost seemed as if we were bothering her Other then that I did enjoy to food My clients took my husband and I here while we were in Blacksburg on business last week I had the soy ginger shrimp tacos and crispy onions which were delicious! We also shared a crab dip between the four of us and I loved that too I would definitely visit this place again if we come to Blacksburg again I\&#39;m already craving the tacos! Let me just start off by saying that my fiance and I frequent Cabo a few times a month for the following reasons: 1) The food is good and consistent - I typically get either the chicken or tofu tacos and they are yummy! 2) The service is good and when you run out of salsa (this happens in like 5 minutes for us) they readily bring more chips and salsa 3) The atmosphere is awesome and the decor is unique Eat the fish tacos; you won\&#39;t be disappointed! If you\&#39;re looking for classical West Coast food but on a middle class budget this is the place for you Served on a lighter than air tortilla each taco has beautifully cooked seafood and the freshest veggies Sit outside if you can because its a bit dark inside I went here with some friends before moving out of Blacksburg and I have to admit I wasn\&#39;t impressed Maybe I just don\&#39;t like fish tacos but theirs was pretty gross The fish was breaded and deep fried and smothered in a nasty mayo-like sauce I\&#39;ve had fish tacos elsewhere that I\&#39;ve liked but theirs is so rich it makes your stomach queasy The atmosphere was nice and the wait staff was friendly but their food wasn\&#39;t really anything to write home about The only place outside of the southwest that I\&#39;ve had an authentic tortilla Their fish tacos take me back to Puerto Piasco Mexico and the corn salsa is great If you want baha-style Mexican food Cabo is the place to go PRO\&#39;s: strong (and reasonably priced!) drinks; great atmosphereCON\&#39;s: This is NOT Mexican food If you go with this in mind you won\&#39;t be disappointed in the food It\&#39;s pretty standard American fare with a slight hint of Mexican flavors Is it as good as you would find on the West Coast? No Are you kidding yourself if you think you would find something like that in Blacksburg? YupThis place is great in comparison to anything else you might find around here I love the corn salsa they bring out to snack on The cheese or artichoke dips make great apps I\&#39;ve never had a bad taco whether from the standard cabo fish taco they derive their name from to the BBQ Mahi (and if you aren\&#39;t a fan of seafood the steak tacos are good as well) And the potato salad is like none other I\&#39;ve had before Decent place to grab lunch with some friends Honestly I ordered one of the typical fish taco dishes (cant recall) but I was hungry ~1-2 hours later I rather spend the same money at Chipotle and be full for half the day! Good food but extraordinarily bad service To begin with our server mocked me when I asked a question about the menu Then immediately after serving us our dinner she demanded to Know if we were going to eat or drink anything else When we said that we may want something else (heaven forbid we may have wanted another drink or desert) she rolled her eyes and stormed away An overall awful experience Food was great spicy  juuuust the way I like my food Lots of sea food options Service prompt Virgin mojitos were delicious We had the fried calamari taco as well as blackened tuna taco both delicious My favorite restaurant in Blacksburg! The food is unique and delicious The bbq mahi tacos are my favorite! The shrimp and crab dip is also very good The service has always been good The margaritas are good as well The food is not bad but in general not very taste filled For a place that has fish taco in the name I expect the fish taco to be really good Unfortunately it\&#39;s just OK I\&#39;m not sure if it\&#39;s the quality of ingredients but the taco just tastes bland! But the mashers are deliciousOverall I enjoy nice summer evenings on the patio at Cabo enjoying a workman\&#39;s margarita It\&#39;s a pleasant place but the food isn\&#39;t anything special MOOD: Nice area in downtown Blacksburg the patio seating was full on this beautiful evening but the atrium was also a nice place Lot was small and full had to find parking on a nearby street Very casual with a somewhat bar-like atmosphere The menus were very worn outSERVICE: Waitress had too much presence but things were delivered timely and correctly FOOD: The free chips and &#34;salsa&#34; was not good The chips tasted bland and stale while the salsa was just corn and chopped roma tomatoes that were cold like they were just taken out of the fridge I would have been happier with a jar of store salsa and a bag of tortilla chips Entree was the blackened mahi-mahi fish taco with the original caborita The margarita was sub-par they had a lot of other choices but I went with a medium one I can mix a better one myself at home with store margarita mix The fish taco was decent a nice amount of zing to it from the spices but overall had a colder mouthfeel to it It was about as much as I could expect from seafood in landlocked Blacksburg VA There aren\&#39;t too many decent places to eat in Blacksburg but it has about the same quality as a chain store where it should excel College students give it more praise than it deserves I love everything on their menu I usually go for the tacos (calamari shrimp or fish) but the burritos are awesome too Really you can\&#39;t go wrong with anything on the entire menu This is hands down my favorite restaurant in the area Not a fancy place but a great selection on the menu mostly fish based taco/burrito items they also had a good beer selection Good service; i liked the &#34;college town&#34; atmosphere I definitely recommend WOW!!\&#39; This place is excellent! Came here really hungry and left absolutely stuffed The chips and salsa were different but good Just the right amount of spice Had the Tavarue Tuna fish tacos and they were unbelievable My wife had the BBQ Salmon tacos and loved them too Service was good and it\&#39;s no surprise the place was packed Highly recommend eating here There\&#39;s something so addicting about this place I make a point to go every time I\&#39;m away from school for even a weekend and over summer breaks I sit around and dream about it It\&#39;s probably the best food I\&#39;ve had in Blacksburg although I doubt it would be half as successful if it was stationed in NOVA The usual wait is around 45 mins on a weekend for dinner and up to 2 hours on football weekends I usually get the calamari tacos but last time I tried the soy ginger shrimp and they were FANTASTICCCC Perfectly crunchy and full of flavor! I\&#39;ve also had the blackened mahi mahi which was pretty good but never as good as fried food I think they changed their mashed potato recipe cause the last few times I\&#39;ve had them they\&#39;ve been cold chunky and not tasty The salsa and corn is refreshing and really really addicting we always end up asking for another helpingA great place to meet up with friends for drinks and a huge filling meal I\&#39;ll definitely miss it when I graduate! Cabo has an extensive list of margaritas that are all super yummy! It\&#39;s worth going here just for that fact Besides the yummy (and strong) drinks they make Cabo also makes some super delicious food Their fish tacos are great (imagine that) But I strongly recommend the Sweet Blackened Tuna salad The tuna was seared to perfection and topped with an apple raisin chutney and the greens were both fresh and refreshing Cabo\&#39;s website says it was created with the &#34;idea of combining coastal Mexican cuisine with a healthy California feel&#34; I think they accomplish this The food is stellar The atmosphere is fun and relaxed You can sit inside in a sort of veranda or outside I suggest outside regardless of where you sit it\&#39;s always a good time at CaboJust be prepared that if you like frozen margaritas that\&#39;ll cost you an extra clam or two Fantastic laid back atmospheregreat when it\&#39;s warm out! This place used to be great when it first opened I was a huge fan Over time though the service and food quality have really fallen The fried fish tacos are always pretty good with their avacado spread but I would stay away from anything that has shrimp in it The last 2 times I had them they tasted really &#34;off&#34; with the last being inedible The corn salsa is different and okay when you don\&#39;t get the old whither tomatoes in itThe other thing that really holds this place back are the sides Most of them are bland and tasteless or poorly prepared Take out service was courteous The smell of late-night partying about knocked me over when I went in so I wouldn\&#39;t choose to eat in this dark windowless restaurant The queso was very good and the chips were fantastic The black beans and rice that came with my tacos were yucky The blackened tacos weren\&#39;t really blackened but they were good  I\&#39;d order again My most favorite place to eat in Blacksburg Combines my two favorite foods tacos and seafood! Love the beer-battered calamari tacos soy ginger shrimp tacos and the buffalo shrimp tacos I\&#39;m not a fan of bbq but the bbq mahi mahi is not bad too Also just found out you can order two different tacos in an order but you just pay for the higher price taco Also the crab and shrimp dip is AMAZING with their awesome pita a must try Best Taco in Blacksburg Great food great price nice place Cabo is pretty good if you want to switch it up from the regular downtown bar fare I have never sat inside and I\&#39;ve never been when it\&#39;s crowded It seems dark and small inside so I\&#39;m sure I wouldn\&#39;t like it However the corn salsa that comes with the chips is delicious and the fish tacos are pretty good - the best you\&#39;ll get in Blacksburg And I am partial to anywhere you can sit outside in downtown My family hails from California and I lived in Colorado most of my life I have also been to MexicoThe food at Cabo Fish Taco is miserable Mexican miserable tex-mex and miserable California fusion Bland watery the salsa isn\&#39;t even good Canned corn is the base of it with not enough red onion cilantro and absolutely no kick I only went there twice because the second time someone else was deciding and paying I\&#39;ve tried their fish tacos the burrito grande the chicken tacos and an appetizer southwestern roll thing i kept trying other people\&#39;s stuff in hopes that something was palatable Even my Azularita was weakHorrid Do not go there I miss this place It was one of my favorites in the burg when I lived there I was excited to find out the abandoned looking building across the street from the off campus Tech Bookstore was going to be a fish taco place The tacos are really good the chips and corn salsa was delish the salads were a little salty and the fake sushi-esque rolls were so-so I have tried the wraps and burritos as well but can\&#39;t remember if I was wooed by them or not Oh and I enjoyed the cheap margsOn a different note: There is a tequila club here where you get a card with your name on it And everytime you take a shot of a specific tequila you can check it off the list of 50+ tequilas I definitely did not join the club however my friend did He vowed to complete the card in one summer It was a very drunken summer for him and me who tagged along for support I asked if he won a tshirt or anything he said no just the satisfaction of checking off every tequila on the card! hahahaha Aww I miss the drunken days/nights of blacksburg! The food is decent but there\&#39;s nothing exceptional or interesting about it It\&#39;s a shame that the menu isn\&#39;t a little more interesting When I go I get the bbq mahi tacos or the epic tuna burrito which are two of the better items on the menu They do have good margaritas and a huge tequila list They also have a pretty nice patio outside so it\&#39;s a great place to go in the summer with friends for margaritas Excellent fish tacos! We have a junior at VT and this was our first time at Cabo They will let you try different tacos on your two-taco order The Tavarua (tav-a-roo) Tuna Tacos and BBQ/blackened mahi-mahi are definitely recommended Staff is very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu and the IPA is cold This place will be a regular stop for us from now on! Great mexican food with american flair at fair prices I have been here several times and have never been disappointed This is my favorite place in BlacksburgI go in about twice a week It\&#39;s pretty quick prices usually range about 8 or 9 for a burrito or tacos with a side It has a baja southwest theme and they have an assortment of tuna shimp mahi mahi for their taco and burritos also chicken and steak as wellThe shrimp an crab dip as an appetizer runs about 7 and is probably the best thing on the menu Decent priced drinks Margarita Monday you can get a basic margarita for 250 They\&#39;re usually playing some type of reggae music yeah I\&#39;m not sure how that fits the baja theme either The wait staff is pretty cool on the hippie sideOn nice days you can eat outside I sit at the bar most of the time because I am a regular but you also have an almost separate non smoking section too I would hop a plane to Bburg just for Cabo well almost! Love this place! Plenty of menu options for all your friends and the buffalo shrimp tacos are to die for! Inside and outside seating and you can grab a couple drinks and play pool upstairs if you have to wait for a table And for Steppin\&#39; Out 2007- they filled the entire parking lot with sand how can you not love it!? This is a great place to grab something light to eat The tacos and burritos are great The bar staff is always friendly Good selection of beer and spirits Tons of different tequilas to make your night interesting It\&#39;s great to eat on the patio when it\&#39;s nice out Inexpensive and fresh food - GREAT place!Only negative is lack of on-site parking Only 6 or 7 spots in the gravel lot You can find some parking north in the neighborhoods but would be easier to walk there But this is true for anywhere in downtown Blacksburg Be sure to try the Epic Tuna with cabbage! I love this place It has a good options for various food restrictions and staff is wonderfully good-natured and helpful I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a laid-back delicious meal (it will fill you up for sure) Just be warned they don\&#39;t take reservations and get extremely busy so you might want to try early dinner or lunch or wait a while to get seated at normal hours That\&#39;s the only negative and that\&#39;s only one because everyone else loves them too! Great place Have been here twice while in town for business Waitresses are awesome Food comes quick It can be a little loud inside when the place is packed but it\&#39;s really all about the food which is outstanding This is a great place to go if you sit outside and order one of the fish tacos The inside atmosphere is loud and crowded with students I have always enjoyed the fish tacos and a workman margarita When I have ventured out to try other entrees I have invariably been disappointedThe side dishes are also lacking in flavor Luckily the tacos are sufficient and worth going for We go about once a month during good weather Did takeout so we could eat at the hospital nearby Loved the BBQ mahi tacos and the carnitas The soy ginger shrimp tacos were too sweet for me I didn\&#39;t enjoy the sides: black beans and rice and the rice with mango chutney or whatever The jalapeo mashers had WAY too many jalapenos Scrape them off and they were great The best part was the crab and artichoke dip and the fried pitas Wow! Delicious! We have been here numerous times and the food is alway tasty I usually get the lemon pepper shrimp tacos and my husband gets the fried calamari tacos We\&#39;ve also had the chicken quesadilla The service is fast and friendly and the drinks are great! I constantly go back to Cabo Fish Taco because of their Soy Ginger Shrimp Tacos and their jalapeno cheddar mashers However today I found an ant in my ice water When I told the waitress she did not even apologize and just didn\&#39;t seem to care much Yes she did offer to bring me a new water but I\&#39;m afraid I just do not trust this place or their service anymore I don\&#39;t understand how others rated this place so highly First impressions I thought the place had a great location full bar and outdoor seating that is just lovely on a day like the day I ate there Unfortunately this place is just crap when it comes to service and although ingredients appear to be fresh there is a total lack of imagination and spice I really feel for the young college students who serve as wait staff and have to put up with a completely inept kitchen We waited nearly an hour to receive two dishes I really wish the food was worth the wait calamari was sub-par and the mahi mahi burrito was drenched in a mayonnaise based sauce that smacked of laziness on the part of the cooking staff that prides itself on &#34;fresh ingredients&#34; To make matters worse the dinner did not sit well so I think I am being generous giving Cabo Fish Taco two stars In a bigger city CBT would struggle to survive The only thing good about my fish taco platter was they jalapeno cheddar masher They really needed to change the oil they fry food in The cilantro white sauce was some cakey tasteless sauce and very minimal filling Again the tortilla was fried in rancid oil The calamari was slightly better since I drenched it in aioli Ive also never had calamari served with cocktail sauce definately a disappointment Even if I didnt compare it to SoCal fish tacos it was not worth the calories The only reason Im giving it 2 stars is I havent tried (and probably wont) the other dishes Very good This was a road trip stop for lunch and worth the few extra miles out of the way After living in Charlotte NC for two years I was psyched that the &#34;other&#34; location of Cabo Fish Taco would be in my new home Blacksburg I really enjoy their corn salsa chips and margaritas The tacos are good but not quite as good as the same menu items in Charlotte It just seems like their other location makes the tacos with a bit more love more fish better tortillas and more flavorful mexi-slaw I would give this place 4 stars if I hadn\&#39;t been to the Charlotte version Still a good standby Energetic yet we could still talk as a family Absolutely delicious food Flash fried homemade taco shells ( so they are light not greasy) filled with perfectly cooked fish shrimp calamari chicken and then crunchy cabbage Flavorful fresh salads Friendly atmosphere pool table upstairs Loved it! An entire restaurant dedicated to fish tacos? Sublime Wonderful food (and a not-to-bad margarita either) Really enjoyed the Silver Surfer Margarita a combo plate of BBQ Fish Taco and the Cabo Fish Taco but the Cabo got my attention Crisp fish and crunchy cabbage with a great sauce They also have a Jalapeno Mashed Potato as an excellent side The food is really good I love their corn salsa which they bring you with tortilla chips They also have this amazing crap and shrimp dip This dip is very flavorful The best part of this dip though is the pita chips I\&#39;m pretty sure they fry them They then dust cheese on them This appetizer is super good and is sure to be a table hitTheir crab and shrimp cakes are also good They have very little filler These are grilled and not fried which is the way I love them They\&#39;re topped with a spicy aioli which is a sort of a creamy southwestern sauce I always get them with the mexi slawTheir best dish though is the rasta pasta It\&#39;s sort of a spin on alfredo pasta It has a pineapple cream sauce with bowtie pasta The sauce is awesome It also has shrimp and chicken which are both sort of spicy but so goodThey have these ridiculous cheap and oh so good margaritas The workman\&#39;s and el cheapo YummyNow here\&#39;s why I took away a star It seem like about 1/4 of the time I go in there with just my husband we get horrible service because they have these big tables I guess these waiters just assume because there\&#39;s only 2 of us the tip isn\&#39;t worth caring aboutSummary: This is great mexi-cali food cheap alcohol typically good service Great for celebrating anything with parents if they\&#39;re in town visiting especially if your parents love margaritas Great soy-ginger shrimp tacos Very accomodating with kids as far as menu options! We always head to this place It\&#39;s one of our regular B\&#39;burg restaurants Cabo Fish Taco was not around during my years in Blacksburg as an undergrad so I was pleasantly surprised when I visited town over the summer and ate here and vowed to add it to my regular places to eat for future visits to town It\&#39;s a huge step above other places in town if you\&#39;re in the mood for tacos and \&#39;ritas The food here is amazing It tastes fresh and natural and isn\&#39;t weighed down with grease and cheese My husband and I each ordered an order of tacos (the beer battered white fish and the lemon grilled shrimp) and split them I had previously had the garlic buffalo shrimp and loved them but wanted to branch out and try something new since I don\&#39;t get to visit that often All of the food I\&#39;ve had here has been delicious I enjoy that you can choose a side and they are different than the typical rice and beans The \&#39;ritas here are also highly recommended There are many to choose from but the restaurant doesn\&#39;t use pre-made bottled margarita mix it is their own recipe made in house so they are much more flavorful than what you might typically get at a restaurant The reason this restaurant loses one star is due to the service We went at dinner time on a Football weekend Saturday so I expected there to be a wait The restaurant does not allow you to call ahead to have your name placed on the list but if you show up in person to be put on the list they will call your phone when your table is ready so during the hour+ wait we were able to go to a nearby bar and have a few drinks while we waited for the call When we hadn\&#39;t heard back in an hour one of the members of our party walked back and they told her it would be another 20 minutes Within 5 minutes of that they called her and said she had 2 minutes to get back to the restaurant When we arrived we were told our table wasn\&#39;t ready and were asked to wait upstairs I\&#39;m not sure if perhaps two different hosts had been dealing with her but it was annoying to be told we had 20 minutes then told we had only 2 or we would lose our table only to show up and have to wait even longer They also had quite a number of tables in the upstairs area that were empty where the supposedly serve appetizers only I didn\&#39;t quite understand why a restaurant would have an hour wait and not be utilizing all of it\&#39;s available space which was frustrating Once we were finally seated the service was fine and we had an enjoyable meal In the future I will go put my name on the list an hour before I\&#39;d like to eat or I will wait and enjoy Cabo on Sunday before I leave town when perhaps the wait isn\&#39;t as bad NB: My ratings are scaled for Blacksburg Five stars here is equivalent to about three stars in the San Francisco Bay Area Cabo is passable for Southwestern Virginia but don\&#39;t go here hoping to find California-style fish tacos The corn-based salsa is fairly tasteless and features frozen or canned corn The fish tacos are be soggy and flavorless or rather the flavor is mainly that of mayonnaise Some of the fish burritos such as the wasabi or the epic tuna have a hint of flavor but again they suffer from bland doughy tortillas and other low-grade ingredients that you\&#39;ll find at a high school cafeteria I\&#39;ve been on a serious fish taco kick for more than a year and ordered them recently in coastal California Minnesota coastal North Carolina and Virginia The best by far were at the Cabo Fish Taco in Blacksburg The fish was perfectly prepared and the cabbage was extra fresh and crunchy I\&#39;ve been twice and can\&#39;t wait to go back soonworth the drive from Roanoke I like this place and for the Blacksburg area it\&#39;s unique Their fish tacos are okay and possibly the best I\&#39;ve had in Virginia They don\&#39;t really compare to something from So Cal though I usually either play it safe with the fish tacos or gamble with the special Depending on the night I\&#39;ve had some really good food off the specials menu then I\&#39;ve had some I\&#39;d of rather sent back Overall it\&#39;s hit or miss Everything else off the regular menu is usually a disappointment Although you would not think it from the external decor Cabo Fish Taco is one of the best restaurants in downtown Blacksburg The menu is a great combination for seafood and non-seafood lovers The inside decor is amazing with high ceilings and big screen televisions for sports Wait staff is helpful and knows the menu well Get the Rasta Pasta!!! Great restaurant A+ WOW I love me a fish a taco The best of Blacksburg for food Service is great esp Kirsten Get her to drink with you sometime she\&#39;s wild I moved away from the Burg a few months ago and I miss this place The queso dip with the spice GREAT the corn salsa GREAT and the fish tacos are great BUT get the shrimp tacos THE BEST This baja seagrill is perfection! There are only two locations in the United States but if you\&#39;re ever lucky enough to stumble across one I encourage you to try it Their ingredients are so fresh and their taste is very unique I suggest any of their tacos their dips and ESPECIALLY their rasta pasta I personally was not a huge fan of Cabo Fish Taco because they seem to use a lot of mayonnaise in their dishes and of mayo I am not a fan But this was a favorite among my roommates and I do admit that they have a good selection of baja cuisine The island food style provides a fresh alternative to all the American burgers-and-fries joints that are all over college towns like Blacksburg This place is so hit or miss I\&#39;ve had some great wraps here when they first opened But lately it\&#39;s been just plain disgusting Do not look very closely at the restaurant (walls floor decor) because it is dingy and dirty and you may lose your appetite The mashed potatoes have been served cold every time I\&#39;ve had them The mexi-slaw is usually good though And the wraps just depend on who is cooking that day as to what you will get The outdoor area is nice when the weather cooperates in the Burg The service is horrible just like almost every restaurant in the area Yes they do have a decent selection of tequilas if that is what you are looking for But as far as food I would go somewhere else A fun vibe to this place -- it was packed on a Friday night The fish tacos are great I wasn\&#39;t too crazy about the corn salsa Friendly and competent staff Parking is a hassle during busy times Lets start off with the food and then move to the serviceThe food is definitely overpriced I\&#39;m paying $13 (before tax) for steak fajitas and receive half a plate full of just chopped tomatoes cheese and lettuce and on the other half of the plate a small pile of grilled meat and veggies which was more like 2/3rds veggies and the rest meat I could get that (and maybe more and/or better) for 1/3rd the price at Taco Bell and 1/2 the price at Chipotle Their margaritas are very expensive and you can receive something twice the size for the same price at Chu-Cho\&#39;s or El Rodeo (3-5 minute drive from Cabo) For not being sat mediocre service loud and bar-like surroundings dining at Cabo isn\&#39;t worth your buck But if you\&#39;re all for supporting local business go for itService-wise I had a terrible experience I have a medical condition which prohibits me from consuming gluten - I made this clear to the waitress prior to even ordering any drinks When I inquired her about any marinades sauces etc that were used on the meat she readily assured me that everything was &#34;fine&#34; and gluten free Upon receiving my dish the meat was drenched in soy sauce I asked her to double check what the meat was cooked in and what do you know teriyaki sauce and soy sauce (almost all generic brands of teriyaki and all brands of soy sauce contain wheat)! She didn\&#39;t even know what the dish was cooked in and had prior told me everything was fine without checking with the cooks At this point I wasn\&#39;t offered an alternative dish or half price on my meal or anything I didn\&#39;t even receive a &#34;sorry&#34; This definitely left me with a bad impression of the restaurant and the service provided If you have a medical problem I can\&#39;t give you any other advice other than to hassle your server to make sure all your needs are metAll in all not happy with the place My first and last time there I wish I could give it 35 stars since this place is a little out of the ordinary The food is a little above average but lacks good flavor It\&#39;s mostly fresh but not much imagination put into it It\&#39;s too much of a college bar to be a good quality restaurant but the tequila list is decent The margaritas are also slightly above average but better than most in the area They do use mix in the drinks but it\&#39;s better than most other places that use mix If you\&#39;re drink comes out bright green it\&#39;s as fake as a UVA football fan Go ahead and squeeze a lime into a glass it\&#39;s not very green Nobody needs that artificial crap in your body just demand more out of a restaurant The corn salsa is decent but takes quite a bit of Tapatio to get it anywhere near spicy enough The service is usually pretty decent despite the drunk dudes occasionally trying to make their night miserable The restaurant is what it is though a decent college bar with slightly better food than the rest It has a lot of potential to have great food and drinks but is a great change of pace in Blacksburg Been there a few times and the food has always been great though I\&#39;ve only got various tacos Awesome Tequila selection This is delicious for dinner a little expensive for lunch They have a bunch of tequila\&#39;s not as many as Red Rocks in Centreville for all those NoVa natives in Blacksburg but a good amount The music is usually really good and they serve their food pretty late too Great customer service and excellent donuts! They did not accept cards last time we were here but they do now which was convenient We will be back! You can\&#39;t make a visit down to Virginia tech and leave before going to carol lees One of my all time favorite donut places! I highly recommend the blueberry donut it\&#39;s hands down the best blueberry donut I\&#39;ve ever had! I also love the cinnamon sugar! A MUST if you are in the Blacksburg area This is a cute local donut shop that serves up some delicious treats I recommend the chocolate glazed and the blueberry glazed All of them are amazing though! It\&#39;s best to go first thing in the morning when the donuts are hot and fresh! but if you can\&#39;t make it out early they are good all day long :) A nice local donut place Basic donuts nothing fancy but made there fresh daily The flavor in the donuts are nice not over powering and not trying to identify the donut flavor One of the Blacksburg signature places The best donuts in the whole wide world! You can\&#39;t beat this flavor They sell out quickly your chances are slim after noon on the weekends so make sure to get there in the morning This is one of the gems of Blacksburg and a place that I look forward to every time we are in town This business has taken many shapes in my lifetime my favorite was when it was on College Avenue and you could watch people pass by Now it is located on North Main Street and has only outdoor seating It is set up now to be more of a take out restaurant A dozen non-filled doughnuts is $8 This includes flavors like maple glazed chocolate with sprinkles vanilla with sprinkles Oreo Cake and blueberry cake I also highly recommend the raspberry filled doughnuts If you are on a budget and don\&#39;t mind broken or ugly doughnuts they also sell &#34;Grab Bags&#34; It was perfect for me when I was a broke college student Carol Lee is the way doughnuts are meant to be! After reading so many rave reviews I wanted to love Carol Lee Donuts The best thing I can say is that the young man who served us was friendly I had a glazed donut which was sadly without flavor but for the faint taste of the oil the donut was fried in The donut was fresh and had a nice airy quality to it but it was flavorless So far the best donut I have had in the NRV area was from a Marathon station on 460 located between Newport and Pembroke If you want an excellent donut I suggest you go there And WOW! I stopped in to pick up some donuts for a meeting with my account and was blown away with the selection service and unbelievable taste! Since moving to the south (from Bucks County PA) it\&#39;s almost impossible to find great bakery like donuts anywhere! Now it will be a stop for sure every time I\&#39;m in Blacksburg! Great little local donut shop!!!! Couldn\&#39;t have been happier with these donuts They have a great variety and I tried many different donuts I didn\&#39;t dislike any of them Also the pricing wasn\&#39;t bad at all Less than $10 for a dozen variety donuts (yeast/filled/cake) again these donuts were great! I love good donuts and I\&#39;ll most definitely visit again the next time we\&#39;re in town Amazing! We came from out of town and had heard about Carol\&#39;s They did not disappoint! The donuts were super flavorful but light so you could eat more than one or two and not feel completely stuffed Will definitely be coming back next time we\&#39;re in Blacksburg! Fresh yeasty delicious donuts They are the best and not overpriced like the donut shops in the DMV We got a dozen for less than 10 bucks Alright Carol Lee you did your reputation justice I had never been in this area before but I came down for a VTech weddingand of course everyone literally EVERYONE told me I MUST go get Carol Lee Donuts I mean I like donuts but I was really thinking &#34;how good can a donut place be?&#34; And to be honest I am impressed It\&#39;s such a small and simple shop with big flavors and really delicious donuts I like that it\&#39;s simp shop and it has a homemade feel to it It doesn\&#39;t have any bells and whistles and it doesn\&#39;t need any They just let the donuts speak for themselves What I like most about the donuts from here is that they are not overly sweet and I think the dough has a better bite and fluff to it than other places They remain soft even the next day and never get that hard shell with expired donuts from DD or other places They are CASH ONLY and it\&#39;s easy to pick up a dozen donuts for $8-$10 depending on what kinds you are getting They will certainly run out of flavors later in the day so go early I especially liked the White fluff filling donuts the blueberry and the cinnamon rolls I picked up a dozen to bring back to my co-workers and the box was gone in minutes! Try them!! If you didn\&#39;t get Carol Lees at least a thousand times did you really go to Tech? LOL jk but really Carol Lees has some of the BEST donuts I\&#39;ve ever had (and I\&#39;ve tried a lot of donut places) The store itself is tiny It was in walking distance from my apartment so I\&#39;d walk out there on the weekends for my donut fix Bring cash because if you need to withdrawal the ATM takes a fee My favorite donuts are the blueberry and chocolate cake donuts They are perfectly made The Bavarian cream donuts and the sprinkles were also a hit in my apartment I typically don\&#39;t like filled donuts but the Bavarian cream one is not overly sweet and is quite delicious Actually all the donuts here are delicious I recommend them all A Blacksburg staple! By far one of the best donuts I\&#39;ve ever had Only complaint is that Carol Lee isn\&#39;t on my way to work! Any kind of donut you get is a winner THE BEST DONUTS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!! Will return to Blacksburg just to get these donuts! Haven\&#39;t found a place that makes donuts this good or soft! They are better than Sugar Shack Duck and Fractured by a long shot! Their jelly filled custard filled blueberry cake and chocolate iced are my favorite ones! This place makes the best donuts I had ever eaten I ate them today and the last time before this visit was in 1992 (seriously) when I bought them for my thesis defense presentation audience The taste and quality is unmatchedThis place is iconic and no one should leave Blacksburg without eating a lot \&#39;cause you won\&#39;t find such donuts anywhere Best donuts in Blacksburg I highly recommend the toasted coconut Cheerful and prompt service Great prices! As the best place to get fresh made donuts in the Blacksburg area Carol Lee is always on my list of places to swing by when in the area I am a big fan of their cake donuts particularly the blueberry but you can never go wrong with the cinnamon sugar donut eitherThey are pretty reasonably priced at $5 for a half dozen; they\&#39;re cash only but they have an ATM on site if you forget! It is also worth noting that there is no seating either indoors or outside at Carol Lee so be sure to go in prepared to get your donuts to go You may also have to wait for parking as there are not that many spots This is my go-to place several times a week The staff is always goes above and beyond with customer service Most importantly the donuts are heaven WOW!!! Absolutely amazing! The best donuts I\&#39;ve ever had! Good thing Carol Lee\&#39;s is not in Williamsburg VA! Can\&#39;t wait to come back again next time we are in Blacksburg! For donuts this is the place to go Outstanding tasting Donuts That\&#39;s all I ordered and I was very satisfied Best place to get breakfast in Blacksburg The donuts are freshly made and always taste wonderful Only downside is that they don\&#39;t deliver! Just kidding but easy 5 stars!!! Can\&#39;t beat it Making my way downtown walking fast faces pass and I\&#39;m homebound But first stop by Carol Lee\&#39;s for bomb diggity donuts! Split a box of half a dozen with a friend and it tastes like donut heaven! Flavors I tried so far toasted coconut cinnamon sugar and chocolate glaze with sprinkled! Gotta get \&#39;em all!Also we went around 11am Not super busy but still had lots of great selections! This is the best pastry shop in southwestern Virginia and southern WV Go to numerous ones and nothing tops Carol Lee Overall: 45 starsBest donuts I\&#39;ve had Great donuts with better service! I would recommend Carol Lee Donuts to everyone and try to get visitors to stop by during their visit Fair prices but unfortunately only accepts cash/check So just go to your local ATM and get lots of cash Food Quality: 45 stars Near perfect donuts! Best donuts I\&#39;ve had as I would prefer Carol Lee Donuts over Krispy Kreme and Sugar Shack Though it does not have the variety/flavors of Sugar Shack Carol Lee Donuts perfects the common/regular flavors Very fair price getting a dozen donuts for less than $10 If you love donuts go to Carol Lee Donuts ASAPService/Experience: 45 starsThe staff is ALWAYS friendly and welcoming Never had any problems or complaints with the staff but my only issue is with the payment method They do not accept debit or credit cards as they only accept cash or check They do have an ATM on-site but with a small service-fee Wish they could change this policy and accept debit/credit cards! Small donut shop with limited parking spaces but rarely found a time where it was difficult to find a parking spot I rarely ever give out 5/5 star reviews - but this place really deserves it The donuts here are a perfect combination of fluffiness and stuffing that isn\&#39;t replicated at any other bakery or donut shop I\&#39;ve been too in the US That coupled with the great service and amazing prices makes this place one of the best hidden treasures in Blacksburg VA Awesome place with awesome people! Recommended the blueberry donut and it was great Always friendly faces working at the counter I showed up around 9 am on a weekday and was shocked to see the display case was almost completely empty When I attempted to order some donuts I was told they were out of almost everything which was disappointing to say the least I was told they would have more donuts in an hour They agreed to let me put in an order to pick up later but inexplicably refused to sell me anything with a filling such as Bavarian cream or raspberry filled Apparently those take too long 1 Star for the service but bumped it up to 3 stars since the donuts were decent and the price was very reasonable Eat donut from them is a kind of tradition for a lot of Blacksburg people! They are extremely good not overly sweet and cheap!! And when you buy a lot or late they will also give you bonus! But remember they only accept cash! Cash only!!! We went around 3pm and they were out of mostly everything I wanted to try the roasted coconut but they were out Luckily there were still some jelly filled ones left and they were pretty delicious I like how many variety of donuts they have even cake donuts (which I\&#39;m not a fan of) But get there early! LOVE this place! Carol Lee Donuts is an iconic Blacksburg spot that everyone needs to try at some point Pros:VALUE: Their normal donuts are $070 each and the filled donuts are $085 It doesn\&#39;t get much better than thatTASTE: These are the best donuts I\&#39;ve ever had VARIETY: They have tons of different donuts to choose from! Everything from cream filled to sprinkles or just plain! :) FAMILY OWNED: I love that Carol Lee Donuts is a family owned spot that has been in operation since 1968 Everyone who works there is super friendly! :) Cons:I can only think of 1 but they only accept cash or checks Although there is an ATM on site :) This place is amazing and I hope it\&#39;s around for many more generations to come! Picked up a dozen donuts today and my office was not disappointed My favorite donut is the blueberry I love this local Blacksburg gen Everyone talks about it and it\&#39;s easy to see why Only issue is they only accept cash But for a small business I can understand that LOVE LOVE LOVE Is this place &#34;Blacksburg good?&#34; No It is just plain good It wouldn\&#39;t matter how large a city I lived in or how much selection I had access to I would come here Price and donuts are great Just note that they are cash only The curse of Carol Lee is that no other donut will ever stack up Despite slight inconveniences (cash only have to get there earlyish a little far from campus) these are the best donuts I\&#39;ve ever tasted and I would easily go far out of my way to get them They are cooked morning of so they\&#39;re incredibly fresh they pretty much melt in your mouth are never dry and the owners are wonderful people You can place large orders ahead of time and the donuts taste just as good for up to two days (if you can restrain yourself!) Don\&#39;t hesitate to try any flavor; they\&#39;re all amazing Carol Lee\&#39;s is a Blacksburg staple Back in the day they were located down on College Avenue They have always had THE best blueberry cake donuts Especially good warm as are the blueberry holes! We also inhale the chocolate glazed donuts twists and lemon filled; a family favorite All though Krispy Kreme &amp; Dunkin\&#39; Donut shops seem to be popping up all over the place like a crazy Ex hold out for Carol Lee\&#39;s She\&#39;s got the good stuffI was happy to hear from the lady at the register they cook in soybean oil no hydrogenated oils (artery clogging trans fats) so eat Carol Lee\&#39;s not Krispy Kreme your heart will thank you If you want a donut and you are in the New River Valley area try Carol LeesThey are a cash only business so bring it or use the ATM If you\&#39;re a donut lover living in the Blacksburg area you can\&#39;t beat Carol Lee Not only are the donuts amazing but they\&#39;re affordable too The staff is also super warm and generous The whole place gives you that homemade feel! I like all of the doughnuts here! Toasted coconut Bavarian raspberry cookie n cream cinnamon and sprinkles are the ones we normally go for! The doughnuts aren\&#39;t greasy they are cooked nicely and are light and fluffy! I have been going here for almost 5 years so I\&#39;m pretty familiar with their donuts Up until a few months ago I would have given them 5 stars but something has changed and they don\&#39;t taste the same anymore I don\&#39;t know what is going on maybe different ingredients but the change is not for the better and it\&#39;s too bad because they used to be fantastic Really wish they would go back to the way they used to be yelp star rating is based ONLY on the Donuts and ONLY on One Visit and only the three Donuts we consumed! Overall we were pretty disappointed! The Donuts were ok not awful just not real goodBavarian Cream-Filled Chocolate Iced Donut was the best of the Three we ate until I got to the Cream Without the Cream 3 1/2 yelp stars and I know I usually like very few &#34;Creams&#34; yet I was hopeful this would be a Very Good oneChocolate Iced &#34;white&#34; Cream filled Donut (of course) hmmm this one had better Cream (better than their Bavarian) though the Donut itself was just okGlazed Simple Donut 3 yelp stars! This could have been so much better and maybe if we had arrived many hours earlier I could have ranked this one with the greats though I\&#39;m not sure how much better it would beValue! This are Better than almost all Grocery Store Variety and are Cheaper than most Donut shops slightly figured in for my inflated yelp star rating!Worth Mentioning even though the following comments were NOT factored in to my yelp star rating:Decor (hardly cute) though this place should have a Ton of Charm being in a restored though NOT refreshed Gas Station you need to be going there ONLY for the Donuts! SRO : If I had a Business like this I would do just as they have done with NO Place to sit = NO Tables NO Chairs! Just enough standing room to place your Order and LeaveThough it is SMART it is NOT Welcoming!No Tables or Chairs Outside so I sat on the RED &#34;Box&#34; (covering for the old gas pumps) and enjoyed these Donuts (as much as I could)Staff was one Girl very pleasant and did not treat me as if I had never seen a Donut shop like thisSign is HIGH in the sky though VERY Drab a little too plain We drop by this donut shop frequently when shopping in Blacksburg The thing I love most about their donuts is their CONSISTENCY I\&#39;ve never had a stale donut or one that was under-iced They\&#39;re always just right Equally consistent is their service -- quick and friendlyI\&#39;ve had a pretty wide variety of donuts from this shop -- chocolate cake donuts cinnamon sugar blueberry oreo crusted plain yeast donuts All have been delicious (I\&#39;m particularly fond of the iced chocolate and the cinnamon sugar)At big chain donut shops (I\&#39;m looking at you double D) when their donuts are good they\&#39;re really good -- but they\&#39;re so inconsistent with how they ice their donuts how fresh they are and especially with service especially between stores As other reviewers have said prices are very reasonable but make sure you bring cash if you don\&#39;t want to pay an ATM fee You could not ask for better food and coffee They don\&#39;t take credit cards! Still worth trying! A shining star in Blacksburg Cannot say enough good things about them I\&#39;ve never been disappointed with the donuts or the staff or the quality of product Amazing every single time you go and if you\&#39;re lucky enough to get a warm oneyou just may get a glimpse of heaven I have stopped at Carol\&#39;s on several occasions finding the best donuts I have ever had A great way to treat yourself The donuts made here are like little morsels of heavenliness They don\&#39;t make a bad flavor - they all taste great My personal favorite are the raspberry or blackberry filled ones They are so good You should definitely make this a stop if you are ever in Blacksburg Va Folks --we tried this on a hunch --and all the way from Alaska --( on our way to the Greenbrier) ITS A MUST --the only ? Is how much to order ??Answer:\&#39;all you can carry --the glazed donuts were still tasty2 days later!! The best place for donuts They have a huge variety to choose from and the donuts are just amazing When you go to a business on Yelp and find all five star reviews that tells you this place is doing something right There is usually at least one dufus that wants to come give it two stars just to be contrary And after visiting Carol Lee Donuts I can safely say this is a five star donut shop We live in VA Beach and our donut selection is basically the chains I like KK and DD just fine but there is something nice about an independent shop So while in town watching my beloved OSU Cowboys get beat by Tech in hoops we decided to stop in here before heading back Man what a great place The glazed donuts were outstanding as were the maple and chocolate glazed We also had some chocolate cake donuts that were delicious I wish we could have tried more but maybe next time Just as a quick warning they don\&#39;t take credit cards so come with cash However I can most definitely say that in my opinion this is as good as it gets for donuts If you are in Blacksburg stop on by and check them out You won\&#39;t be disappointed A must find Best glazed donut I\&#39;ve had in Virginia Note* cash only! 6 amazing donuts for $5! If you\&#39;re visiting VTech detour for a dozen! My wife and I get these doughnuts every Sunday for our Bible study group for which we range in attendance between 60-80 mostly VT students from nations all over the world Even with all those varying international taste buds we have not met anyone who did not think the doughnuts were incredible! Keep up the great quality!Side note: we had a friend who tried to carry her box of Carol Lee to Taiwannot advisable especially when running through the airport to catch a tight connection! Not much I can add to what other reviewers have already said but:Carol Lee if you\&#39;re reading this you make the best doughnuts in the world and I love you Try the Bavarian Cream cinnamon sugar and chocolate glazed with peanuts Coffee is good too Oh Carol how I love thee! Best donuts in the area! The toasted coconut is my favorite but really anything you get from here will just be melt-in-your mouth deliciousness I only allow myself to come here every now and then because I know I can do some pretty serious damage when I\&#39;m around these things! Go get one or 6or 12now if you haven\&#39;t already! Cash or check only! Excellent local donut shop where the donuts are made on site and not trucked in Quality always seems to be consistent and the cinnamon rolls are very good The cake donuts are just a little soft for my taste but the taste is good Wish they had seating so you could eat them there A few picnic tables would be great for when the weather is nice Cash only Heaven I\&#39;m in heaven And my heart beats so that I hardly speak And I seem to find the happiness I seek When I\&#39;m out in Blacksburg eating Carol Lee\&#39;s Got a chocolate with sprinkles pretty much the only donut anyone needs It was great and met all donut expectations I\&#39;d go back for sure Doughnut delirium!! Have one of each -- they\&#39;re that good!   This place is what Dunkin\&#39; &#34;Donuts&#34; wishes it could be Best donuts! It is cash only but they do have an ATM if you forget The Blueberry Cake donut is fantastical! So moist and perfect The White Delight was heavenly the creme was just sweet enough but not so sweet to overpower the goodness of the donut itself (which is delicious) The coffee is perfect donut shop style coffee and piping hotSuper inexpensive as well Only $5 for half a dozen mixed donuts and 2 coffees Can\&#39;t beat it and well worth every penny It does not have indoor seating but there are a couple of covered tables outside This is a must visit place in Blacksburg The relationship between you and your diet is about to become contentious Carol Lee is one of the handful of places I\&#39;ve been to in town that I can sincerely and unequivocally describe as being good No reallynot just &#34;good for Blacksburg&#34; but actually GOOD I have favorites of course but honestly all of the doughnuts we\&#39;ve tried were great  Bring your cash (no credit) and if you come during peak hours be prepared to do battle for a parking space in their small lot It\&#39;ll be worth it Honestly best donuts I\&#39;ve ever had The donuts are light and delicious and all the people are so nice! Don\&#39;t forget to try a plain glazed they\&#39;re amazing When I think of donuts I think of Carol Lee This place has set the bar for the best donuts I have ever had I live in Philadelphia and no place even comes close to the quality or taste of Carol Lee  If you are a student at Virginia Tech this is a must Get the following three donuts: 1) Cinnamon Swirl 2) Boston Creme and 3) Glazed This place is local but if you are visiting from out of town I would highly recommend it Delicious donuts! Get there early on the weekends they close once they run out of donuts Cash only Simply the best donuts that you will ever have Fresh and delicious!Nothing more needs to be saidCash only though! There is an ATM in the store in case you forget Hands down some of the best donuts I\&#39;ve had in the US They were fresh and absolutely delicious Cash only which is annoying but the donuts are inexpensive so it\&#39;s understandable The bottom line is that Carol Lee Donuts is a fantastic find in a part of the country littered by substandard chain restaurants Highly recommended Stopped by late on Saturday so selection was not great but the cinnamon rolls filled and cake donuts we were able to sample were excellent! I decided to order a box of a half-dozen to get a good variety I picked the Blueberry Cake Toasted Coconut Devil\&#39;s Food Chocolate Iced Chocolate Iced with Peanuts Cinnamon Sugar &amp; Bavarian Creme filled for my six doughnuts They are $70 each individually and I believe it was just under $400 for a half-dozenAfter now having tried all six flavors the Blueberry Cake &amp; Toasted Coconut are my two favorites There\&#39;s nothing fancy about the blueberry cake but this cake doughnut is extremely light and the berries tasted stronger than usual in most other blueberry doughnuts I\&#39;ve tried For a contrast the Toasted Coconut was a glazed yeast doughnut but topped with shavings of toasted coconut The coconut gives a unique texture and a sweet nutty flavor that works well with the yeast doughnut I\&#39;m not a coffee drinker but this seemed like a doughnut that would pair perfectly with a cup of coffee Carol Lee I don\&#39;t know who you are but I thank you for a delectable and extremely cheap breakfast Especially your toasted coconut yeast doughnut Yes indeed I wish I had been able to wake up early enough to try them hot and fresh but a couple seconds in the microwave brings me just as much joy A must when in Blacksburg Oh my word these are the most amazing donuts I have ever had These donuts are dream-stuff wrapped in dough and then fried in such a way as to just explode with deliciousness in your mouthYou may think I\&#39;m overstating things that I\&#39;m letting myself get carried away with how awesome these donuts really are but all I can say is that I assure you that these are otherworldly and lovely Best donuts I\&#39;ve ever had!! They sell out early on game weekends so get there early My personal favorites are the maple and glazed Yum! Stopped here late one morning Interesting little place the donuts were delicious I got a toasted coconut regular glazed and a cinnamon sugar My favorite by far was the toasted coconut! Can\&#39;t wait to go back ! God-like doughnuts Go early because doughnuts go fast and will be gone by close Never visit blacksburg and not go here Cash only has an ATM Price is more than fair These are the best doughnuts you may ever have My whole life I have loved Chocolate Glazed (a chocolate donut with glaze) and I think it\&#39;s the best I\&#39;ve ever had Bavarian Creme is greatIf you are a Student Org looking to make an impression on a company get carol Lee I just moved across country and getting half a dozen Carol Lee\&#39;s and grinding out work for a few hours is something I will miss I went here this morning It\&#39;s Sunday The parking lot was cray cray But this isn\&#39;t a parking lot review or a seating review or a decor review from me this is a donut review We got two glazed One coconut glazed two choco glazed and an apple filled glazed I ate three and they made my tastebuds and belly very happy I went for a jog after Because I don\&#39;t want to have donut body K bai Apparently all the ones that people dont buy go to pig farmersFavorites: White Delight Toasted Coconut and Lemon Filled Best donuts in the NRV $8/dozen always fresh alway delicious They only accept cash Good thing I live far away from this place or I\&#39;d visit everyday and weigh 500 lbs! What are you waiting for?! Why are you still reading these reviews? Go get some doughnuts! No really These doughnuts are as good as it gets and extremely inexpensive (But don\&#39;t forget your cash) My favorites include anything filled so I can vouch for the deliciousness all of the jelly and cream filled doughnuts offered Also be sure to go early enough so that the best ones aren\&#39;t gone These donuts are inexpensive yet delectable Unlike Dunkin Donuts\&#39; donuts every bite is both filling and dense They are not light and airy so one is enough to feel like you\&#39;ve had your fix They have the richness of homemade dough and the taste of an upscale bakery I have yet to find a donut there I didn\&#39;t love and because of how cheap they are I can usually get a half dozen for a mere couple of dollars I highly highly recommend this place--it is a little known gem of blacksburg! Coming here is like taking a step back in time It reminds me of something off the set of &#34;Maximum Overdrive&#34; except without the killer trucks and machineryYou pour your own coffee out of pots warming on burners and a medium cup is only 90 cents Yes 90 cents!The donuts (their spelling not mine) are amazing fantastic and delicious I left with some that were filled others chocolate covered and even a few cinnamon rolls Everything was homemade and the grand total was less than $9!Sara Lee? No CAROL LEE! This shop certainly serves one of the best donuts I\&#39;ve had amazing donuts in Georgia and I really wanted to go back Fortunately this shop serves even better donuts! The only downside is that they only take cash but the price is so darn cheap that it\&#39;s almost embarrassing to use debit/credit cards to begin with I normally eat their donuts for afternoon snacks when I am pressed with immense amount of work Their donuts always help me brighten my mood! Seriously give this a shot Yum! Soft yeasty deliciousness! The taste lingered in my mouth for hours causing me to crave more I wanted to go back to get more to take back home with us but we were &#34;too far&#34; away to go back We will go back!!! Loved the $1 mystery bags and they had $3 day old box of a dozen For a fresh dozen and two mystery bags (5-6 donuts) we only paid $10! I have to say the donuts are amazing When my friends from New York City visited me I bought a dozen of carol donuts for them I m so glad they just like it Days ago my friends called me and said they miss the carol donuts by the way and me The plain glazed donut at Carol Lee\&#39;s takes this humble breakfast confection to new heights  I urge you to skip all the overly sweet toppings and try a plain one first  I would drive well out of my way for these Hands down this is the best doughnut shop The doughnuts are simply delicious and impossible to resist! In addition to the taste visiting Carol Lee Donuts has brought decades of meaningful tradition to our family I even keep a list on hand of everyone\&#39;s preferences! Lemon filled and old fashioned cake for her blueberry and chocolate glazed for him maple yeast and cinnamon sugar for me etc The price is affordable the tiny shop is clean and the owners show pride by still making the doughnuts and serving their guests every day! Last time we visited we were so inquisitive that the owner gave us a tour of the doughnut-making process in the back of the shop They still use old fashioned machines and make doughnuts the best possible way without cutting corners on quality Because the shop is small don\&#39;t expect to sit down inside If it\&#39;s warm enough outside you\&#39;ll be able to enjoy your doughnuts at a picnic table out front In the winter you\&#39;ll want to take your doughnuts to devour at home This old time family business is charming and just plain good! This place is the reason I get up early on weekends and why I gained so much weight Good donuts the blueberry one was small but really good the chocolate covered one was good but I didn\&#39;t love the white filling as much I\&#39;ll definitely be coming back I\&#39;ll look forward to the Bavarian cream Solid donut shop Its no chain deal and the donuts are always fresh I have been there at least 10 times and the quality never wavers I\&#39;ve had their doughnuts once and here\&#39;s what I have to sayThe doughnuts were artisan quality good feel good taste but not overly sweet like the Krispy Kreme or even Dunkin They are simple yet amazing Best donuts anywhere I travel a lot am far from a health but and can assure you these are the best donuts you will find I have no idea how long CL has been open but I have been going for over 40 years; downtown and now on North Main There are great breakfast and brunch options in Blacksburg but if you only have one morning make it Carol Lee It doesn\&#39;t get much better than thisCarol Lee Donuts is known for being the go-to donut store in the Blacksburg areaThe donuts are fresh delicious and cheap With choices from Bavarian creme to maple iced to vanilla iced with maroon and orange sprinkles you really can\&#39;t go wrong You can pick up one two or have them fill a box with a dozen of your choosingCoffee is diner quality but it\&#39;s hot cheap and gets the job doneNOTE: The only reason they\&#39;re not getting the fifth star is because they only take cash NO CREDIT CARDS They do have a conveniently located ATM inside that charges a fee I do not know what it is I get that maybe they don\&#39;t want to pay credit card merchant fees but it\&#39;s 2014 Overall amazing donut shop Local not a chain a town favorite You do need to go early and have cash but it is worth it! One of my favorite things about Blacksburg!!! A visit is never complete without eating at least a dozen carol lee donuts Just great great donuts made fresh every day Donuts are in the style you would find at a Dunkin donuts but about twice as good! There is a reason why this business has been in Blacksburg forever Love the Bavarian creams the best and toasted coconut comes in a close second Love this place Very very tasty!  Great way to start your day  Bring Cash - no credit cardsmakes it hard to expense When I lived in Blacksburg I would go here every Sunday to get the family donuts Forget all the chain doughnut places this is the only place to go if you want real homemade donuts This place has the best donuts in Blacksburg! You can smell the aroma of fresh made donuts bright and early in the morning or come in right at closing time and get extra donuts It\&#39;s awesome! My favorites are the Bulgarian cream filled or the chocolate glazed regular donut I would recommend trying them all The smell is the first thing that hits you Ahhhhh Donuts  Probably the best donut I ever had You\&#39;ve got to try this place Coffee was tasty but weak If you like dishwater coffee aka tea buy it here but hey IT IS ALL ABOUT THE DONUTS 500% good! Best Donuts in town! I have used Carol Lee for many meetings and my clients love them Great local place that you can count on! I have never been inside of Carol Lee Donuts but I have eaten my fare share The donuts are amazing with a wide variety to choose from Excellent to grab a box and take into work if you work near by It is a town favorite for sure great doughnut shop always fresh and amazing smells They also worked very nicely with me for several cakes (engagement party cake birthday cake graduate cake) and each cake was not only beautiful but absolutely delicious! The only issue is you MUST pay for doughnuts with cash I understand since the doughnuts are so cheap that credit card fees would contradict the income from the doughnutsbut couldn\&#39;t they have like a minimum doughnut order amount in order to use a credit card? Not sure Anyway bring cash to be safe you will want to try every flavor they have!! These are the best doughnuts in the world! I\&#39;m not usually a big fan of cake doughnuts but these are just sooo good They have plenty of varieties I didn\&#39;t think I\&#39;d like a blueberry doughnut but man It is good My brother likes the chocolate chocolate so good Their yeast doughnuts are good too Whenever I head back to the burg for a game I always try to get here to get a dozen doughnuts When my brother was in school he would stop by on his way home (middle of the afternoon) and they would throw in free doughnuts with his dozen for him to get rid of them He loved that! When I think of my time in blacksburg and food i think Carol Lee Donuts and Mike\&#39;s Burgers My favorites Super good donuts at a reasonable price The seller is really nice I\&#39;ve recommended it to many friends Carol Lee Carol Lee You and I were meant to be Thank you for your wonderful donuts You are my favorite place to eat You make me happy and that\&#39;s enough to keep me coming back for more Still miss you guys being downtown way back in the day But you still are the greatest Just ask my kids We went out of state They got some donuts and immediately asked if we could go home and get Carol Lee Donuts The best of the best Simply amazing I live a few blocks away and honestly I would pay extra now just to stay here This place is delicious cheap and friendly I\&#39;m going to get so fat but I don\&#39;t even care This is the best place you can get donuts in Blacksburg by far Not only are you guaranteed quality but the choices are extensive and I have yet to find one that I didn\&#39;t like Another great thing about this place is the costumer service Incredibly nice people working there and an example of that specifically effected me one Sunday afternoon just before they were closing when I ordered about half a dozen of a variety of donuts and they gave me a dozen for free as it was the end of the day Awesome!! MMMM best doughnuts you\&#39;ll eat anywhere staff is always friendly Fresh donuts Blueberry chocolate glazed and more! You can buy a bakers dozen for about $7 which is incredible for fresh donuts Special note they only accept cash so be sure to visit an ATM beforehand All that\&#39;s left to say is NOM NOM NOM! Other donuts will taste like a dirty sponge after you have some from Carol Lee! The prices are fabulous the service is quick and friendly and you CANNOT eat just one! The iced with sprinkles are my favorites! Cash or check only so be sure you check your wallet before going! How can you not like Carol Lee Donuts? Good variety and fair prices As someone who rarely carries cash remember to take cash with you! I\&#39;m not someone who frequents a bakery in general as I\&#39;m not big into the sweets However donuts are another story altogetherI am a donut addict and had been sober for a few years before someone opened a box of carol lee donuts Let me just say that they were incredible I\&#39;m sure their cakes are good too who knows but the donuts there must be cocaine in themThey have a lot of choices and you will feel like a kid in a candy-store Choose wisely friend This is my favorite donut shop The prices are great and the taste is even better! Several times when I\&#39;ve gone in the afternoon they\&#39;ve given me extra donuts free of charge Still outstanding donuts Unfortunately the cake lady part of this bakery is now closed (the lady retired and there was no one to take over the cake) but the donuts are the real draw The best I have ever had-fresh delicate just the right amount of toppings  Nothing even like them in NYC I have found I imagine Carol Lee is at a similar caliber with the first Krispy Kreme This place has the best freshest donuts anywhere! It\&#39;s so good that it\&#39;s worth writing my first and only Yelp review for Carol Lee\&#39;s The irony is I don\&#39;t think they need reviews to reaffirm what Blacksburg townies already know! I\&#39;ve been trying to find something of the same caliber in northern Va but with no success Worth driving 4 hours for!! Great local donut shop My son and I had a regular thing to stop in after swim lessons each Saturday morning I miss that and he does too! This place is classic and has donuts that can\&#39;t be beat Toasted coconut melt in your mouth doughnuts And the best lemon filled doughnut i\&#39;ve ever had Unfortunately it can\&#39;t be an everyday thing for me lest I grow back my pakistani uncle belly Carol Lees is the best donut shop in the world The blueberry ones will knock your face off I\&#39;ve lived in Richmond Orlando and LA and there\&#39;s still nothing better than Carol LeesGo hokies! Hands down BEST donuts in town! Perhaps the freshes and best donuts I have ever had This place also makes AMAZING cakes! Also great prices for as good as it is!!! 35 stars!only tried their donuts before fresh donuts made daily! there\&#39;s something about fresh donuts that just taste better than grocery store donuts you should try to get there earlier in the day or else you might end up getting donuts with limited selectioncash only! I went here 3 separate times for 3 separate meals over this week I\&#39;ve visited my friends in VA so I\&#39;ve broken my review up by meal The dinner option of pacos is also on the lunch menu too!!DINNER: The vegan pacos is SO good That\&#39;s an entree in and of itself honestly I ordered the Tofu Gado Gado subbed seitan and brown rice it was a nice spicy peanut sauce The bite of Korean bbq tempeh and broccoli I had was really good too like a beefy steak I didn\&#39;t get to try the Gillie\&#39;s and Mushroom burger but they looked /really/ good My friend wasn\&#39;t enthused with the Gillie\&#39;s burger herself but i didn\&#39;t get to grab a bite personally The only issues we had with a party of 8 was a glass with a lip print on it (although my friend was too shy to speak up) and the waitress misheard us and brought us a nonvegan pacos at first Luckily my group was suspicious of how melty the cheese was so we caught it! Service was very nicThe mousse is vegan and DIVINE SO RICH Seriously you\&#39;re going to want to split it it\&#39;s the best My cheeks tingled with happiness as I ate it If you\&#39;re unfamiliar with mousse it\&#39;s like a dark chocolate aerated pudding must try BREAKFAST: came for Sunday brunch and got a Veganized Red Earth It was really yummy they did try to upsell with vegan cheese which would be even more yummy but I didn\&#39;t feel like spending the extra $2 at the time The tofu sub was $150 more which was a bit of a bummer but understandable The tofu was cubed and tasted pretty nice! I wonder if they\&#39;ve ever tried to crumble it for texture Overall I\&#39;m really happy I chose the Vegan Red Earth I chose the honey wheat bread because I don\&#39;t mind honey and don\&#39;t like white breads I think next time I\&#39;ll try buckwheat pancakes with blueberries although I\&#39;m not sure if they have real maple syrup or vegan butterLUNCH: I tried their seitan bbq wrap and it was godly I didn\&#39;t know if I would like it because I hadn\&#39;t had coleslaw in a long time (being vegan and all) but it was definitely the right decision I would recommend the BBQ Seitan Wrap or Pacos for lunch based on my personal experience Overall this is definitely a great place to come eat and I can see myself going back here for sure when I\&#39;m in town Great to have these options in Blacksburg  My daughters veggie burger was wonderful My lentil soup was too although the bowl portion seemed smallOut of guacamole  settled for chips and salsa Shouldn\&#39;t have bothered  Tostito cup chips and average salsaNice to have gluten free cookies at cash register for the road at a fair price of $175 Staff great atmosphere quaint and relaxing I had come to this place couple times now and it is famous for being a vegetarian restaurant It is a surprise that vegetarian food can also be tasty I had a smoke salmon salad which the smoke salmon is good but the salad is kind of disappointing I guess I was expecting a little more stuff for the salad part whereas it only have the one type of leaves some carrots and some cheese The sauce is pretty good tho My friend order a another dish with bread with different toppings looks really good and can\&#39;t wait to try it!In general food is good but can be tricky depends on the food you get Not a have to go place but definitely a try if you want something special Love the mostly vegetarian cuisine! The brunch that I had eaten in weekends is yummy! I highly recommend the food! After reading some bad reviews regarding service and portion size I did not know what to expect when trying Gillie\&#39;s I was not a single bit disappointed! Our party of 5 walked in and were immediately greeted by the hostess We chose a table sat down and they brought us water with lemons immediately Our server greeted us told us the specials and gave us some time with the menu He was a very pleasant guy I wanted to try everything on the menu but I ended up going with the make your own stir fry I got seitan with a Thai sauce and soba noodles We also got a side of vegan nachos as an appetizer The nachos did not blow me away They were loaded with toppings but did not have enough chips We ordered vegan cheese on them but I only found two chips that actually had cheese on them My stir fry on the other hand was very tasty There was plenty of seitan and fresh veggies and the portion size was perfect! I really enjoyed this dish My mom especially loved her dish She had the Gado gado tofu It is a tofu dish with veggies and rice in a peanut sauce I tried it and found the sauce to be so tasty! She would highly recommend this dish We went on a Friday night at about 6:30 and there was a solo acoustic act that started playing at 7 It was a bit intimate since it was just us and maybe two other tables in the restaurant The music was pleasant though and not too loud Overall my experience at Gillie\&#39;s was way better than expected I hope that I will be able to return to this restaurant in the future to try some of the other dishes! As an alum I\&#39;m embarrassed to say I never had Gillie\&#39;s before a recent trip back but glad to check it off the Blacksburg restaurant list The little cafe is perfect for locals students and visiting familiesWe arrived shortly after 11 am on a Saturday so we expected a wait given its size Our party of four was quoted 30 minutes and we happily waited outside in the sun for our table They had open tables outside in the shade but it was a little brisk while out of the sun so we opted to wait inside The host was personable and did a great job managing the waiting list We were seated within our quoted time and immediately given waters Our waiter walked over shortly after to get any other drink orders When he returned we were ready to order (&amp; very hungry) I picked the Chappie\&#39;s choice which was two scrambled eggs over potatoes with white cheddar and a biscuit The menu is vegan and vegetarian and has great labeling so that choices are clear Gluten-free friends would like this place too! My friends also ordered the banana walnut French toast which looked great Fun tip- they offer French toast both the traditional way with honey wheat bread or sliced baguette Service was pretty quick and staff was friendly After our meal we were given a check to pay up front before leaving - super great way to avoid the hassle of splitting checks at the table Definitely check out this for breakfast - just know that good things sometimes come with a short wait! This isn\&#39;t my usual go-to place when in Blacksburg but a it\&#39;s a lot of people\&#39;s favorite Food is delicious and cheap I got open spanish frittata and my boyfriend got juevos rancheros The flavor combinations are great and portions are pretty big I really like how they get bread form Bollo\&#39;s right around the corner Service could be improved as they don\&#39;t keep up with water and coffee refills and we weren\&#39;t even given silverware this time The wait for food is on the longer side There can be a pretty long wait to even sit down on the weekends Went here for lunch and brunch (on separate occasions) both were delicious! I got the focaccia pizza - they have a large selection of toppings It was good! Wish they had red chili flakes though Brunch was even better had the banana walnut French toast Super yum perfect amount of sweetness The ambiance is really nice lively during brunch and has a good mix of different types of people- from townies to college students Another Blacksburg Gem! Gillies is a mostly vegetarian restaurant (they serve fish) in the heart of downtown Blacksburg They started out as an ice cream store in the 1970s and then gradually expanded into a full restaurant and then added a coffee shop (Bollos) two stores down Gillies is hands down the best place for brunch in Blacksburg They have a variety of delightful entrees; my favorite being the 122 Special (Eggs Grits or homefries biscuit or toast and coffee or tea) It is named for its original price $122 but now costs $650 Other entrees that I adore are French Toast Biscuits and vegetarian gravy and for lunch Pacos Taco Pound Gillies has so much history for me and my family my husband and I had our rehearsal dinner there We used the whole restaurant and had our own menu It was lovely While gillie\&#39;s has always been a favorite of mine they really disappointed me today when I ordered lunch for my colleagues and myself for pickup I came to get our order and part of the order was wrong While that was quickly corrected I was very frustrated when I asked for a bag to carry my order and was told there were none I had walked several blocks to pick up our food and had 3 boxes and 2 cups of soup and was told they have a new policy of not giving bags The server told my my only option was to &#34;make a few trips&#34; and said she wasn\&#39;t able to help me carry the order despite the fact that there were 4-5 other servers working 5 blocks and two trips later I finally got the food back to my office Very frustrating I\&#39;m all for reducing carbon footprints but not at the expense of customer service Simply the best brunch anywhere My usual is the El Dorado omelette with fresh organic spinach salmon and feta Coupled with squeezed orange juice it is the perfect lazy day meal! I grew up knowing Gillie\&#39;s as my favorite ice cream spot with HUGE scoops No longer for me or them but they have matured with me for the better! Love this downtown classic for 5 decades in the \&#39;burg I have enjoyed coming here So does everyone else on a Sunday morning so get there before 9 or plan to wait awhile! By far the best vegetarian restaurant in Blacksburg The poached eggs Benedict offered on Saturday and Sunday mornings is a must try I finally tried Gillie\&#39;s for the first time after hearing about it so much!I had one of the specials which was a blueberry goat cheese and arugula grilled cheese and I got it with the Asian slaw as my side The Asian slaw was very good and I loved the sandwich! One thing I would say is that it was a little bit too heavy on the blueberry and not enough on the actual cheese but I still really enjoyed eating itThe huge deterrent that would keep me from coming back to Gillie\&#39;s was the service The restaurant was pretty empty when we went yet our server somehow managed to ignore us completely The only times he came to our table without us asking him to was to give us the menus and our food We repeatedly had to ask for things (to order ask for water ask for boxes and to ask for the check) I really hope that the service is better if I decide to come back This place is a gem Its vegetarian but great breakfast I had got the Chappie Choice and my friends got pancakes and French toast Sampled each others great food!!! Gillie\&#39;s had very good vegetarian breakfast fare There was a large variety of dishes to select from on the menu with the expected regulars and some interesting specialties It was a small homey place that serves breakfast lunch and dinner I had the open face Spanish frittata It was excellent!!! It had potatoes artichokes onions black olives tomatoes and feta on it The seasoning was delicious The service was very friendly I would definitely go back Always yummy! By far my favorite place in Blacksburg to eat Their brunch lunch and dinner is always great and their specials always offer something new to try I love that there are so many vegetarian/vegan options since you often can\&#39;t find that around here My favorite thing to order is the Tofu Ruben and potato pancakes You can definitely tell that everything is made fresh and homemade I also like that their little patio outside is dog friendly :) I love the breakfast/brunch menu and the lunch menuHaven\&#39;t been to dinner for YEARS - was over-priced the last time I was there in 00sPS: The coffee still sucks Gillies is a very good choice for vegetarian cuisine I went for their lunch and got the Gillie\&#39;s Burger which is a black bean burger It was a little dry but still extremely tasty The prices were actually pretty cheap and not as expensive as I thought The atmosphere was very relaxed and the service was very good Overall a great choice for vegetarian food and lunch option One of my all time favorite restaurants Everything is fresh the wait staff is always friendly and interesting and prices are ridiculously cheap My only complaint is I wish they had alcohol and served more meat But hey it\&#39;s a vegetarian restaurant Try the &#34;red earth&#34; dish for breakfast and definitely get a biscuit as well I came with my mother and sister on Mother\&#39;s Day to grab brunch after my sister\&#39;s graduation before heading back home to Northern Virginia Since it was Mother\&#39;s Day the wait was quite long but we managed to get a spot at the bar pretty quickly However it took 40 minutes after we ordered to receive our food Apparently they only had two cooks working which was unfortunate I ordered the Smoked Salmon Hash with potatoes instead of grits and was a bit underwhelmed There wasn\&#39;t much salmon and the overwhelming flavor in the dish was tomato from the salsa I also had the toast with the dish which tasted fresh and crisp but didn\&#39;t have much flavor I felt like I could have made something better at home My mother got the Bruschetta which had smoked salmon on top of cream cheese and was quite tasty My sister had the Chappie\&#39;s Choice with a biscuit - the scrambled eggs looked quite good soft with cheddar on top and the biscuit was very fluffy and butteryThe servers were friendly and one even came over to explain the kitchen situation He also made small talk with us while we were waiting for the billOverall I would order something else if I were to return but I was disappointed by the Smoked Salmon Hash and long wait They need to hire more kitchen staff Gillie\&#39;s is a Blacksburg classic and despite being here for years I\&#39;ve never had brunch here This has been remedied and I will be back! Come early and come prepared to wait outside - it\&#39;s popular and there will always be people waiting outside The turnover isn\&#39;t too bad though - my group of four came around 9:45AM on a Sunday morning and had an estimated wait for 40 minutes but only waited for maybe 30 minutes Since it\&#39;s busy don\&#39;t expect the best service in the world since it\&#39;s small crowded and bustling! But the servers will make an effort to be warm and inviting which I was appreciative of Be careful of sitting anywhere near the door they hold the door open to get the next party in and it can get a little cold if it\&#39;s windy outside! Food is affordable and a good mix of sweet and savory options as well as a daily specials menu on the wall I got the bruschetta and a short stack of buttermilk pancakes (two pancakes) and was really happy - bread comes from Bollo\&#39;s so the quality is great and I loved the goat cheese spread with the smoked salmon Pancakes are denser than what I\&#39;m used to with buttermilk pancakes - they\&#39;re not fluffy but they\&#39;re still good almost like a thick crepe? Everyone else at the table enjoyed what they had too - I was definitely eyeing my friend\&#39;s Mediterranean special with salmon poached eggs cous cous and olives! I haven\&#39;t had the chance to come before since my fiance swears off anything that calls itself &#34;vegetarian&#34; but now he says that we should come back I might turn into a breakfast person yet! Also on an unrelated note: there\&#39;s a super cool music scene at Gillies with local bands coming to play and the space becoming a small mosh pit (but there\&#39;s seating if you\&#39;re not into that) It\&#39;s super fun and a great taste of the local culture - I highly suggest going if you spend the weekend visiting! I was expecting this place to be overpriced and mediocre but was pleasantly surprised that it was neither of those things The portions here are pretty big and perfect I ordered the black cat sub and it blew my mind The catfish looked really burnt but after biting into it i realized it looked like that just because of the way it was marinated The sub was great! All of the flavors complemented each other very well and nothing was too over powering The catfish itself was cooked perfectly and not at all dry or chalky It came with a nice little salad of purple cabbage and carrots with a light vinaigrette sauce that also went well with the sub All in all i had a great experience The service is minimal but they check in at the right times If i lived here Gillie\&#39;s would quickly become my go-to restaurant for healthy food and stuff The atmosphere is also great It\&#39;s quite relaxing I wanted to like this more than I did The menu is fun and interesting and the food was tasty But we showed up for breakfast and 6:45 ordered at 6:55 and the food arrive at 7:30 There was hardly anybody in the restaurant but still the plates were leaving the kitchen about one every five minutes When the food did eventually show up it was good -- the 221 special and the banana+walnut french toast -- but it just took so long I\&#39;d like to go back though and give them a chance to get the service right and potentially bump them up a star Best known for their breakfast but their dinner menu and atmosphere is even better IMO We enjoy dinner here once or twice a month Live music on the weekendsa great place to take a date or the family Affordable quality ingredients creative vegetarian and vegan options Love the food here but severely understaffed and inadequately trained Had to track down the server to get more coffee and this was after he came around checking on some tables but skipped us He\&#39;s standing behind the bar staring into space We\&#39;ve been waiting 45 minutes for our food already and being told it could be another 20 minutes If you know the kitchen is slammed how about being upfront about it and doing whatever you can like refilling coffee to make the wait more pleasant It may not be the server\&#39;s issue honestly I\&#39;m guessing it\&#39;s more improper or no training Based on this experience I don\&#39;t know that I\&#39;d be back Great heart healthy lunch and nice folks Vegetarian stew was great as was the nutty salad I wish I was able to try Gillie\&#39;s brunch menu because their dinner menu was kind of disappointing I was excited to find a vegan restaurant in Blacksburg but I kind of wish I hadn\&#39;t The menu is unique and exciting no doubt but the quality and quantity isn\&#39;t good enough for the high price My sister got the seitan arepas and it was tasty maybe a little too salty but there just wasn\&#39;t enough of it My sister rarely finishes anything and she devoured the dish in less than ten minutes I didn\&#39;t eat mine as quickly because it wasn\&#39;t as tasty but the quantity was the same I got the smoked tofu steak and it was honestly just a bland piece of tofu over some cauliflower mash and pickled vegetables Everything tasted fine mixed together but it\&#39;s not something I would ever desire or eat again Additionally our wait time for service and food was very long If it weren\&#39;t for the small portion sizes we would\&#39;ve missed our show! This is easily the worst service I\&#39;ve ever had I\&#39;m genuinely stunned at how abysmal the entire experience wasIn summary: Ordered a dish kitchen ran out of an ingredient so they gave me a dish with shrimp in it Waitress never came back to ask what else I wanted Left without payingTerrible serviceEven worse management0/10We dined here on Tuesday August 14th at around 6:30 pm It was busy but nothing extreme; the student traffic hadn\&#39;t really started in full swing yet We were able to get a table right away and the waitress provided us the menus and later water immediately Unfortunately it was all downhill after thisMy friend ordered the Sonoma Sandwich and I ordered the Fresh Basil Pesto These dishes took far too long to prepare which seems to be a trend for this restaurant On top of the kitchen taking far too long to prepare the food the waitress was absolutely terrible at her job - she might as well not have even been thereWhen the food finally arrived I noticed that my dish had shrimp in it and it didn\&#39;t really look like pesto at all I made sure to double check to see if I missed an ingredient in the description but the Fresh Basil Pesto has no shrimp in it I was eventually able to ask about the shrimp when the waitress returned only to be informed that the kitchen gave me a different dish because they ran out of an ingredient Oh but wait she also told me I could just &#34;eat around the shrimp&#34; One would think you could also bring out the right dish but I guess that\&#39;s too much for this establishmentWhat kind of restaurant substitutes a dish without informing the customer?! Let alone with shrimp something people are notoriously allergic to?! Both my friend and I were shocked that any restaurant would ever operate this wayInstead of eating something I didn\&#39;t order I asked for the menu so I could choose something else I made my choice but I never got a chance to inform the waitress because she never once stopped by our table My friend was able to finish his entire meal which took about fifteen minutes and the waitress never stopped by once There is no excuse for this; I\&#39;ve eaten at far busier restaurants and never experienced such lousy serviceAs my friend was finishing his meal I went up to the cashier and informed them that this was the worst service I\&#39;ve ever had at any restaurant The cashier a blonde girl tried to excuse this away by saying &#34;Well you should know that we\&#39;re very busy right now I\&#39;m not even supposed to be working here&#34; Seriously?! It doesn\&#39;t matter how busy you are or that you\&#39;re not supposed to be here Thats not how you respond to that - you messed up own up to itAround this same time the waitress managed to reappear from whatever dark void she vanished into and asked condescendingly &#34;are you getting your ticket comped?&#34; I told her I was leaving I told them I wasn\&#39;t going to pay for my meal and left My friend later assured me that I didn\&#39;t miss much as his sandwich was subpar Weekend visiting my brother and friends wouldn\&#39;t be complete without a nice brunch :D My friend is a huge fan of this place and I was a little confused when she said it was a vegetarian place It was great though! I got the eggs benedict special (it\&#39;s on the menu though) Soooo yummy and it was on a bed of cooked ARUGULAAA my favorite But I think what really got me was the bread The bread it came with was truly amazing So fluffy/chewy/warm/perfect all-around My brother got the Gillie special but didn\&#39;t seem crazy about it It was cheap though!Good vibes all-around! We did miss our name being called because others ahead of us on the waitlist were gone too so the wait time was way less than what they told us it\&#39;d be It was find because we had been roaming around the farmer\&#39;s market right nearby and put our names back on the list and just waited on the patio I would suggest just staying there to wait! Great local veggie options The art work is interesting I would like to try it for dinner Plenty of outside seating If you know downtown Blacksburg you know Gillies Their food is delicious The service can sometimes be a bit slow but it\&#39;s always friendly It\&#39;s mostly vegetarian with some fish around the edges It is a great place for locals and visitors breakfast lunch and dinner A great Blacksburg tradition What a fun place!! Gillie\&#39;s offers yummy vegetarian cuisine and is still run by family members Go anytime as the menu is great for breakfast or dinner Great food and great service! Had the sweet potato burger veggie chili and blackberry cobbler All were excellent Quaint pleasant atmosphere Great menu with many vegetarian options Staff was friendly and made spot on menu suggestions based on our needs And I particularly enjoyed the sign on the door Lovely place we will return next time we visit Blacksburg Poor service Waited over an hour for hour food Food presentation was mediocre at best and had to go up and ask our waiter for the check and when they returned my change it was only big bills Very good food although it can tend to be a bit pricey Sometimes the wait is longer but the food is worth it The atmosphere is good as well there are often live musicians I wanted to like this place I couldn\&#39;t get past the hostess She was very unpleasant and borderline condescending She seated my son and me at the counter But then made us get up and wait until my other son (parking the car) came in I told her that he would be there in less than a minute She lectured me on some policy about not being able to wait for people when it was busy There was no one else waiting there were a couple tables open and there were seats at the counter She asked me to sign the Waiting List - it was empty My other son showed up within 30 seconds During that time I had a chance to look around the place It looked dirty The staff looked unbathed and disheveled like the zombies on The Walking Dead Hopefully Management will give the Table Nazi some customer service training We left and had a sincerely wonderful experience at Carol Lee Donuts Great vegan choices I asked for the curry extra spicy and the chef did not disappoint! Woo! GOOD STUFF! Its a lil Vegan spot thats right on the nail head Wonderful place Excellent breakfast I love Chappie\&#39;s choice Biscuits are super tasty All fish here is delicious Check the specials This was ok but really not that special We had gone for an early morning hike at Cascades and chose to stop here for breakfast after hiking There was a 30 minute or so wait which was fineAfter being seated the host brought us water and we waited about 10 more minutes for the server to arrive She was all business which was fine She took our orders and we waited about 20-25 minutes or our food to arrive It was ok but certainly nothing worth burning up that much time for I would likely opt to have a Little Debbie and a pack of nabs over coming here again For lunch and dinner the food is fresh fantastic dependable and reasonably pricedSome standards remain on the menu and they try new things too If you want to hold a conversation with the people you go with don\&#39;t go when they have live music because the volume is always turned up too high as if it\&#39;s a concert and not background music Call ahead and askOtherwise I love eating at GilliesAs for breakfast and brunch Gillies is the best in town Wellll to start I\&#39;m in the service industry so I always tend to have high expectations for service/restaurants when I go out to eat and I rarely even write yelp reviews unless I feel really strongly about a place good or badWhen I visited Gillie\&#39;s I was in the area from out of town also vegetarian and really excited that the town had something that was directed more towards vegetariansWhen we walked in we were greeted and told we could sit wherever that our server would be right with us We sat at the bar and were given menus with two waters We waited ten minutes after getting those menus for anyone to even speak to us the only reason I know this is because we were on our way somewhere and had a timeline which we didn\&#39;t mention to the server because they were obviously busy and didn\&#39;t want to be rude Being on vacation your used to being on a small time crunch anywaysDuring the ten minutes of waiting we had a bunch of questions! What soup they had and what were they out of because it seemed that the 86\&#39; list on the wall was pretty full I mean the list had at least 6 items they were out of Kinda unfortunate when you don\&#39;t even know what you can or can\&#39;t order on the menu I feel maybe the server could have told us what they were out of to help us have a better experience with deciding on what they actually had to offerAfter the ten minutes pass the same girl who greeted us and told us that our server would be with us came up to us and asked us &#34;what can I get for ya&#34; Didn\&#39;t ask if we had questions didn\&#39;t ask if wanted anything besides water nothing We had to respond with &#34;well we have a few questions&#34; With a little prying with what seemed to be pretty difficult questions (such as &#34;what is your soup of the day?) we finally got some answers Rudely we were answered with &#34;I\&#39;m not sure it\&#39;s written on the board over here&#34; Which remind you I didn\&#39;t even know they had any specials or a board because A I wasn\&#39;t told about them and B I was sitting at the bar which the board wasn\&#39;t visible from my seatWhile waiting for the food which was barely up to par we hear her talking to coworkers about how she\&#39;s &#34;grumpy today for no reason just grumpy today&#34; We observed the cook preparing our food wearing a hat with a decent amount of hair hanging out the sides I\&#39;m pretty sure a hairnet should be worn I don\&#39;t think the hair length would be okay by health code The bread for my sandwich was so thick I could barely chew it and it\&#39;s served with chips and salsa that I could buy at the grocery store Needless to say I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;ll be making the trip back to Gillies I wish the place would have been better but the rudeness really made it hard to enjoy the lunch I am so disappointed that I had--not one--but two unpleasant experiences at Gillie\&#39;s after hearing so many people rave about this place The first time I went with a group of friends in January--it was snowing and they told us to wait outside until a table was ready Seriously?! It wasn\&#39;t very busy so I was surprised we were told to wait in the freezing snow They called us inside and showed us to a table that hadn\&#39;t been bussed yet There were water glasses and some napkins on the table when we sat down A server came by and refilled the dirty glasses from the previous table I told him that they were old glasses and he only brought ME a new water none for my friends I had to tell him two or three times that the table was dirty when we sat down Whatever On to the food I got their southwestern whatever breakfast burrito: it was bland bland bland Even with salsa on top! I remember it being a sad soggy mess after eating it for a few minutes No seasoning whatsoever The side of potatoes though were pretty damn good Still needed ketchup So that was my first experience The next time was similarly unsatisfying There were a couple tables besides us maybe three or four and it took the server about fifteen minutes to bring us menus and water He took another fifteen minutes to come by and take our order All three of us got the salmon burger and I assume the patties were frozen It took AN HOUR for us to receive our food which is ridiculous The salmon burger was once again plain seasonless boring The bun was very good though The accompanying chips and salsa tasted like they were purchased from the dollar store I gave this place two tries and was very unimpressed No wonder there was a Help Wanted sign on the door Gillie\&#39;s needs a lot of help! Got the south meets southwest catfish and goat cheese grits with a healthy dose of rocket Add in the Devils backbone Azreal beer and i am delighted with the experience Mu son had the Tofu reuben and it was inspired I will say it was good enough that i forgotTo take a picture until i was done I have always been a huge fan of Gillies I\&#39;m a senior now and I\&#39;ve gone so many times during my time at Virginia tech Last weekend I went for the first time this year and was so disappointed To start off we walked in and never got greeted or even directed where to go There was a long line of people trying to pay and so when we went up to the host stand to get seated she was busy handling the customers paying We asked two different people who to see to get seated and got no answer Finally we got a seat but it took over 10 minutes for our waiter to even come say hello Our waiter was unfriendly monotonous and looked like he was dreading being at work We both ordered Chappie\&#39;s Choice and after our waiter took our menus we said we wanted the biscuit rather than toast He told us as he was walking away they were out of biscuits so we didn\&#39;t even have a chance to change the order or request something else Our food came out and it was average Not the amazing food we are used to and the kitchen forgot to toast my bread I asked for a toasted piece and it came out at the end of the meal On top of everything our water was warm because they said they didn\&#39;t have ice We will not be returning Great tofu breakfast scramble with spicy salsa! Service slowness was unreal though and they put cheese on my vegan scramble and it took 20 minutes for them to make a replacement I have eaten here about 5 times The food is always pretty good they like to experiment and surprise you with creative dishes (typical Vegetarian restaurant) The food is fresh and usually tastey I just recommend looking around at what the people around you ordered since the dish might be different than you\&#39;d expect based on the menu description 4/5 times I\&#39;ve been here the service has been unfriendly They are kind to locals but if you\&#39;re from out of town or clearly a student they aren\&#39;t as nice Overall a decent restaurant and frankly a Blacksburg classic Don\&#39;t come here hungry come here an hour before you think you\&#39;ll be hungry There was a long wait for brunch on Saturday and the service was slow and apart from our server who was nice ever so slightly rude On the other hand the food was good We ordered four different things and they were all enjoyed  Fun college town establishment I had the red earth with a fresh baked biscuit and coffee for brunch The food was good and good portions for the price I sat at the bar and had a great conversation with Gillie who has interesting stories to tell and friendly Since it is a vegetarian place you should aware that they don\&#39;t serve meats but make most of items from scratch I\&#39;ll be back! We rarely eat in the house we would just get the nachos to go for dinner Plenty filling and full of veggies! Yum Tastes like real food Nothing better than seeing fresh homemade bread to make your French toast Quality food in a cute atmosphere!! Had breakfast/dinner here several times most of their menu items are really good! I think the only problem is price but like you\&#39;re paying for the quality can\&#39;t really complain Attended today for brunch Busy was kind of let down we had to wait outside for a table because of how cold it was I ordered the Southwest Grits and soon found out they were out so I subbed with the potatoes Decent meal My girlfriend had poached eggs which were a dollar up charge which is fine but they were very poorly cooked Severely overdone All in all okay experience I rarely write a review however the experience at Gillies this morning for breakfast was beyond horrible First before getting to the food I would like to apologize to our server No 77 for whatever we did to ruin your day Perhaps it was simply choosing to sit in your section Maybe it was having a couple questions about the menu It could have even been thinking we\&#39;d be offered a refill on our coffee Not sure but I am sorry to have caused you any inconvenience Of course you have no idea how your almost nasty rude attitude ruined our breakfast nor do I think you care Regarding the food we have a second home in Blacksburg and Gillies is our go to place when we want breakfast out The food is what it is and usually it\&#39;s consistent For the most part it was today as well The pancakes were a little burnt and not piping hot Will we go back to Gillies? Of course we will If I see Server No 77 I will ask the hostess to direct us away from her section I will not allow her the chance to ruin another meal for my family Not completely vegetarian More pescetarian BUT also vegan Unless you\&#39;re in the company of someone who hasn\&#39;t had a meal without killing a cow everyone can be happy hereWe were in Blacksburg for a week and had both dinner and breakfast here We would be delighted to come again Updated review: I shockingly decided to risk bad service and went to Gillie\&#39;s today- waiter was amazing!!! Guy with a beard Great tofu scramble and really affordable mimosa Hopefully they continue to provide good service it doesn\&#39;t matter how good the food is if the service is bad nobody wants to go Don\&#39;t look at the word &#34;vegetarian&#34; and immediately not want to go here! Even though it is vegetarian the food is still really good especially the breakfast here Worth a try you\&#39;ll be coming back for sure to want to try everything on the menu! Vegetarian cuisine is something I never thought I would be a fan of I hardly ever eat a meal without meat in it But I LOVE this place! I\&#39;ve had breakfast and lunch here and few times and I was blown away with how great it was Definitely recommend! Hit Gillie\&#39;s around 11:30AM this past Sunday (8/6/17) the place was packed Since I was solo riding up from Roanoke on my KLX250S heading toward the mountains west of Blacksburg I saddled up on a bar stool and was quickly waited onThe hot coffee kept coming and soon I was chowing on a fantastic breakfast biscuit with smoked salmon partly covered in white cheese and a scrambled egg Off the chart delicious To get some extra nutrition before hitting the mountain trails I also had some of Gillie\&#39;s famous French Toast Out of the park! Jan Gillie came over several times to chat with me as we \&#39;old farts\&#39; have to stick together What a personality A great restaurant under-rated with only 5 stars Get their potatoes all the time!Two of my friends and I came in Saturday morning around 10am and it was packed The hostess told us that it would be a 20 min wait for a table but had a few open bar seats Hungry for breakfast we said yes! Phew what luck! Next to us on the bar were a pile of fresh looking loaves of bread Already excited to order and we didn\&#39;t have to wait long to have our order taken despite the morning rush!As we waited for our food I could peek into a bit of their kitchen where slices of bread were being dipped and grilled for their walnut banana french toast eggs being cracked and sizzled and potatoes tossing and turning in the frying pan!It took about 15-20 min to have our food arrive One of my friends got the beautiful french toast with a side of potatoes my other friend got the poached eggs dish and I got the frittata We all loved it!But in short they have good service even when busy and have excellent potatoes! WowThe food was fast tasty original well-created and is the reason I\&#39;ll be going backThe staff were all polite knowledgeable friendly and efficientThe place was trendy but more than just a neat place to hang outGo to Gillie\&#39;s and you will not be disappointed Especially if you order the veggie wrap with salmon Just wow My family stopped here for dinner while on a road trip and we enjoyed our meals Our server was friendly and attentive and brought us a kid\&#39;s cup for our youngest without our having to ask (you\&#39;d think that would be common but servers often don\&#39;t think to do that) Some of the food we got was good although I would not say anything special but the black bean burger was really excellent I have been to Gillie\&#39;s for everything Regular breakfast weekend brunch lunch or dinner I would recommend it for breakfast or brunch It is great It is also a place where you would get more than one veg options (I have got a lot of vegetarian friends) The service is great as well Gillie\&#39;s is amazing Their potatoes are the best!I first went to Gillie\&#39;s around seven years ago and have always kept coming back even after moving away I loved having a place with of such a lovely variety vegetarian and vegan options available Brunch is probably the best but none of the food I have tried from there has disappointed I think my potatoes were a but burnt one time and even that was delicious-I finished before I could mention it The broiled grapefruit is a nice addition to brunch The pita is fresh and baked to perfection and the hummus is amazing with itThe decorations and atmosphere are great There is live local music some nights which is really nice The employees are always super sweet and attentive and accommodating to whatever you want (ei preparing your food a certain way or a freshly juiced fruit juice another)It\&#39;s also really nice to eat outdoors on a nice day some people will bring adorable their sweet pups with themThere is definitely a variation in noise attentiveness and business levels during the school year and in the summer and different times of the day but never a huge disappointment At most you wait outside for a bit and you come in when there\&#39;s space They messed up our order once on a busy day once but no harm doneMy only possible real complaint is they stopped stocking the grapefruit soda I truly love this restaurant- this being my second time going The beet carrot and apple juice was delicious the omelets are fantastic and are packed with toppings and the french toast is dense and moist The service is impeccable- water comes with the menus and the food was out within 10 minutes $32 for juice tea coffee 2 ginormous omelets (served with the most amazing biscuits and potatoes) and french toast Everything here is so fresh and the staff is happy and cheerful Love you Gillie\&#39;s!PS- What is the their secret ingredient in the potatoes?!? The spice is delicious Nothing wrong with this place I get to eat here about 2-3 times per year and it never disappoints Gillie\&#39;s is my favorite place in the entire world to have breakfast I graduated from VT almost two years ago and I still find myself dreaming of it 300 miles awayEverything on their menu is fresh delicious healthy and affordable As my boyfriend liked to put it everything tasted so good that you didn\&#39;t even care that it was vegetarian (he\&#39;s a carnivore) Something about their honey wheat toast was just indescribably tasty I\&#39;m really not a fan of bread and pasta but I could eat an entire plate of that We usually would order anything on the breakfast menu that had potatoes because let me tell you - those potatoes are to die for They also offer a variety of fresh juices and interesting finds like grapefruit soda - yum! And the staff is incredibly nice Everyone is down to earth courteous and attentive I\&#39;ve searched high and low for another go-to place for breakfast but nothing compares I always find myself saying &#34;It\&#39;s good but nothing like Gillie\&#39;s&#34; Excellent food nice atmosphere We had the crab cakes my husband loved crawfish cakes also excellent and flatbread with cheese spinach etc also very good Great service Om nom nom nom Go to Gillies for Breakfast! This is me and my sister\&#39;s go-to place for birthday breakfast\&#39;s and other celebrations and I swear it\&#39;s the most consistently good place in town The service can be a little snooty and you\&#39;re almost guaranteed to be served by someone with dreads tats and a nose ring so if that\&#39;s not your things Gillies ain\&#39;t your place However if you go GET THE SPANISH FRATATA! It\&#39;s out of this world delicious combining eggs with potatoes black olives artichokes feta tomatoes and balsamic vinaigrette on the side for drizzling Whenever we go we split this with the banana walnut french toast and I have to force myself to stop eating when I\&#39;m full These two things with two coffees and tip is only $10 each which is almost the same as going to Panera I also recommend their broiled grapefruit and biscuits but recommend staying away from the huevos rancheros Gillies does a lot of things well but when I brought friends from San Antonio here and they ordered that it was a bit of a joke For lunch or dinner I like their quesadillas and their black bean burger is to die for I also really like their red cabbage slaw as a side Trust mego I came with high hopes for Gillie\&#39;s Cuisine which was recommended both by Yelp and by locals I give them all credit for providing hearty fare that draws meat eaters to a vegetarian(ish) restaurant Alas though I came twice I was disappointed each time The first time I got the Greek pasta salad No composed salad here--just an undistinguished (and soggy) amalgam of penne spinach and a creamy sauce Undeterred I returned for a late breakfast ordering the spinach florentine with smoked salmon This was a thin bed of raw spinach followed by a soggy slice of (beefsteak?) tomato and then a thin slice of buttered toast topped with smoked salmon then two poached eggs and a garlicky cream sauce The sauce was good The tomato was out of place and of a lesser quality than I would expect at this time of yearIt was fine and I\&#39;d probably come here regularly if I lived in Blacksburg I just didn\&#39;t love it Oh well Very popular place it seems Food was I would have to say just average at best Waiter seemed not too interested in pleasing or was just too tired Ask if we could add onions to our potatoes and his answer was &#34; no not really&#34; SMH Food comes out and the biscuit was cold Not warm cold We asked the waiter if we could get a warm biscuit and he says &#34; our warmer is broken&#34; Yes that was his answer Then we ask if he could put it in the microwave He says &#34;I can\&#39;t take the food back into the kitchen &#34; Then we say can we just get a warm biscuit SMH End of a long story we got a microwave warmed biscuit Food is average and nothing to brag about Poached eggs were perfect that was a plus Check it out and see what you think A good waiter/waitress and a clean restroom makes all the difference in the world We had brunch here on the suggestion of a friend and were very happy with our food Everything was celicious and the portions were good sized The service could have been better we didn\&#39;t get refills of our water or iced tea I\&#39;d definitely go back on a less busy weekend If you are looking for brunch on a weekend in Blacksburg this is a great find The menu is Vegetarian so not the place for you bacon lovers After a 20 minute wait we took 3 seats at the barThe food was delicious the longtime owner was washing glasses and chitchatting with us while we waited for our food This is a real mom and pop place with a son working in the kitchen The French toast special was delicious The two people I was dinning with both loved their meals as well One had an omelette the other pancakes It was worth the wait so good! everyone there is super friendly and the vibe of the place is so inviting! definitely recommend if you\&#39;re into eggs going to be back! Gillie\&#39; s Special and the Blueberry-Walnut French Toast were both fantastic Blueberry bc they were out of bananas Salsa wasn\&#39;t too hot and the potatoes were wonderful if you enjoy rosemary/thyme/garlic fried red potatoes We were in for a wknd and they were serving brunch til 2p Win win Gillie\&#39;s is perhaps my favorite restaurant in Blacksburg Far from formal and expect to wait if you are not in the front of the line for breakfast but the wait is well worth it The classics on the menu are all trustworthy but there specials are always creative and fun This is my all time favorite vegetarian deli I miss living closer to it I have been here so many times and come back every chance I get Loved the unique menu options and the fresh bread from the bakery next door is awesome! My non vegetarian husband and son were also happy the son scarfed down his smoked salmon hash (I got a bit of the grits that came with it and they were so good!) and husband loved the breakfast burrito which had fantastically flavored beans We chose the place for our vegetarian daughter who of course ordered pancakes!  I had the smoked salmon bruschetta and the herbed cream cheese was delicious! The outside dining was lovely and the service great Would like to go back and try some more yummy options Happened by this place yesterday and took notice when there was quite a line/crowd waiting to get in It got me interested and as I was alone I walked in to see if there was a counter where I may sit There was Well sat down had no idea what this place was about and got the cup of coffee I came for When the server (and another person who turned out to be the owner) acted so friendly I thought that I might order some food Turned out to be a good idea and most likely a whole lot better than the tailgate fare that was waiting for me with some friendsOrdered what I thought was steak and eggs and the proprietor told me that they were vegetarian I wanted to leave but since they were so friendly I thought to give it a try Good idea Had some sort of fake steak and eggs in a huevos rancheros style They were excellent And they seemed to take some pride in their hash brown potatoes so I ordered that up as wellreally fabulous and I mostly like that stuff as a ketchup delivery device So good without the ketchup You should give this place a try Great people cool vibe tasty food Gillieyou have a great place here and I am sure that the lines outside say more than I can say here Oh Gillie\&#39;s you\&#39;ve captured a part of my heart that I don\&#39;t think I will ever get back From your eclectic southern hipster charm to your fresh vegetarian dishes I am completely smitten I am glad that this was my last meal prior to leaving Blacksburg We came on a weekday morning for breakfast and found the restaurant not busy in the slightest The food was superb: Their freshly squeezed pear juice is unique and an absolute must for the morning as are their made from scratch cheese biscuits The salmon bruschetta was a blissful bite of dill cream cheese smooth slightly salty salmon and sweet red peppers My boyfriend had the specialty French toast which had more than plentiful bananas and walnuts as the name guarantees; I really enjoyed the fact that they have options for toast: honey wheat or French baguette and that the slices are not overdrenched in eggI was extremely gleeful throughout the whole meal and I\&#39;ve found myself lusting for more since we left The portions of our brunch were huge almost insane We waited long to get our food and when we finally got it it wasn\&#39;t as good as we were expecting AMAZING! As a celiac there were A Lot of great and delicious choices! Bread from the bakery next door was fantastic We will be back a lot Super friendly staff and quite fast considering it was move in weekend at VT and they were full with a wait 5 stars all around! We were looking for typical diner food during a visit to Blacksburg nut the nearby greasy spoon was closed so we ended up here While my older son lamented he couldn\&#39;t get bacon his French toast made up for that The egg dishes were delicious and the grits with greens were fabulous - who would\&#39;ve thunk it? Very good brewed coffee too Great food and friendly waitress! Recommend the Florentine breakfast which has beans instead of potatoes Sitting outside is really a nice choice! Solid down to earth food that has simple ingredients No meat restaurant Hipster for the two decades I have been eating here  Great biscuits and breads  Breakfast is best followed by dinner Went to Gillie\&#39;s for lunch though we were sad that we couldn\&#39;t make it there for the delicious sounding Brunch! There were tons of options pretty amazing considering the stereotype that Vegetarians have less options The aura is awesome the mismatched chairs are a staple of Gillie\&#39;s that were around in 70\&#39;s when my parents attended Virginia Tech They loved the place and it\&#39;s still a great local spot today! I had a Pumpkin-Apple Bisque which was the soup of the day and being somewhat bland was the only disappointing item The salad with apples and walnuts was AWESOME the fresh wedge of bread awesome and the coffee yummy My friends go a quesadilla (lot\&#39;s of options to go in these!) and the nachos which also tasted amazing when I tried them (the chips are unique maybe homemade?) Don\&#39;t pass this place up also was well heated on a chilly day! Obsessed with their brunch Pancakes!!! Yum yum yum!! Only thing lacking is some breakfast sausage (this girl likes her meat - and the soysage just didn\&#39;t cut it for me) FOOD IS GREAT BATHROOM IS DISGUSTINGCome on Gilly\&#39;s CLEAN YOUR FREAKING BATHROOM GROSSI almost did not want to eat here because the bathroom was GROSS But I was hungry and wanted veg food And I\&#39;ve travelled in numerous third world countries so perspectiveQuesedilla with veggies - fantasticAlmond arugula salad - fantasticPizza - fantasticLots of beer on tapGROSS BATHROOM YUCK Jeeze Not too shabby but they can step up some of their options A lot of their food comes with scrambled eggs but there could be great options with over easy or boiled eggs Not a huge fan of the potatoes here and the portions are huge I had lived in Blacksburg for about 4 years and I never once stepped inside of Gillie\&#39;s Personally the whole appeal of &#34;vegetarian&#34; cuisine just never sounded appealing I\&#39;m a steak and potatoes kind of guy down to the core However after not being in Blacksburg for nearly 7 years I had the opportunity to visit over this past weekend and my fiancee really wanted to give Gille\&#39;s a shot for brunch so we didAnd I was really impressed Although on the breakfast/brunch menu you won\&#39;t find your typical breakfast staples of bacon and eggs or eggs and sausage there are some alternative dishes available and all sounded pretty decentI went with the Red Earth dish which is their seasoned potatoes at the bottom topped with scrambled egg (or tofu if you want to go that route) and then topped with salsa (I believe this is home made) with a side of a thick piece of homemade bread The potatoes were seasoned awesome the eggs were nice and fluffy and the salsa really added a nice kick to the entire dish Overall super impressed with Gillie\&#39;s from my initial experience and kind of kicking myself that I never enjoyed their offerings while I lived in Hokie Nation Excellent brunch! I would recommend their brunch to anybody and especially the Gillie\&#39;s special Their potatoes and salsa are both delicious I haven\&#39;t had a poor experience at Gillies They must have changed their coffee provider recently though When I was at vt ~2years ago it was the best cup of coffee I\&#39;d ever had I went back recently and it was underwhelming Still a good cup of joe but nothing to rave about Hands down the best brunch in town! Their lunch and dinner isn\&#39;t as phenomenal however (I learned that pretty early on during my undergrad career dining here) Definitely expect a wait if you\&#39;re going on a morning during the weekend! Depending on the amount of people in your party it can be anywhere from 20-40 minutes Their best dishes are the Salmon Bruschetta the Molettes and the Spanish Frittata If you come early enough they might still have some of their delicious scratch-made biscuits left for you (they run out quickly)! Their potatoes that come with any of &#34;Our Old Favorites&#34; choices are also great and if you decide to go for an omelet don\&#39;t worry - they don\&#39;t skimp out on the fillings you choose! My boyfriend recently had their Tofu Scramble as well and he loved it While you\&#39;re paying your bill at the register don\&#39;t forget to snag some of the freshly-baked desserts at the counter baked from Bollos Cafe down the street! I\&#39;ve been a loyal Gillies fan for the past 5 years and haven\&#39;t been disappointed I hope you join the fanclub soon! :) To start off with gillies food is a 4 I love(d) getting the red earth for breakfast Overall the food is pretty good The problem is the service as I\&#39;ve seen in a few other reviews Gillies does well because many of the workers are friendly and active community members but there are some servers who are incredibly rude I was yelled at outside for giving a 17% tip I won\&#39;t be going back here sad to say This is one of the better restaurants in Blacksburg The brunch is outstanding - I especially like the banana walnut French toast and anything with potatoesThe fresh juices are great too I always get a carrot Apple ginger juice for me and my sonAt lunch my favorite dishes are the tofu Reuben and blackened catfish sandwich Both are really flavorful The food is filling and some days quite good Unfortunately the food can not make up for the rude and often brusque staff The place may continue to draw large crowds but I believe that I will choose other restaurants in the future I am a person who will always tip over 20% they were not able to get over 15% from me I can only assume staff is paid a good hourly rate and does not need tips In a nutshell; service =2 and food =4 Went for lunch Nice ambiance Menu is indeed heavily vegetarian and gluten free I ordered the Black Cat Sandwich - blackened catfish filet with lettuce tomato and chipotle mayo on french bread Good flavor but the bread really overwhelmed the other ingredients Took a while to settle my bill because the waitress was busy talking to the other staff members This is an outstanding restaurant with unique dishes that\&#39;s a good detour from the routine chain restaurants Though I\&#39;m not a strict vegetarian this restaurant is a testament that tasty recipes can be created devoid of meats We went there for brunch on a cold winter Saturday and - as my picky eating kids proclaimed - had the best breakfast of our lives The Belgian waffles with chocolate was outstanding the French toast baguettes with blueberries were terrific and my red earth scrambled eggs on rosemary potatoes was completely awesome Portions were big and the check was not! Bon appetite! When we arrived for breakfast there was a 30 minute wait and due to the size we had to wait outside Fortunately it was a decent day so we waited The hostess was not rude but she definitely was not friendly; however they were busy We sat at the counter and had a great experience They have a fun synergy and cool vibe Our waiter was pleasant and helpful with suggestions The breakfast menu looked great but the food was just okay Everything was under seasoned I love Gillies The food is great But I just waited 15 minutes at a table with no service People who sat after me were served So I left Love love love this place First time coming to eat for brunch after hearing the best reviews from friends I got the tofu scramble with fresh fruit and organic maple yogurt with granola Sister got the Belgium waffle with chocolate chips Everything was delicious and fresh Not impressed I appreciated the reasonable prices but the food was just okay I did like their Paco\&#39;s nachos but they weren\&#39;t extraordinary The waffle was okay  I tried a salad as well All in all it\&#39;s okay  The atmosphere is the best thing about it and I liked supporting a local business I like this place The service is good there are a lot of tasty sounding vegetarian options and the atmosphere is lovely I\&#39;ve tried most of the breakfast menu and a few dinner items and the food is pretty good and most of it is reasonably priced They also tend to have good live music on the weekends Food was good but they were out of multiple staple ingredients Service was a little lacking I think they were understaffed We had our food for 5 minutes before they could get silverware to us Banana walnut French toast! Super casual college type of brunch/ lunch place with cute environment Brings in all types of people which makes for a nice ambiance I also tried the biscuits the salmon hash and the eggs benedict over sourdough All were great dishes because they are so flavorfulHighly recommended for those who are in search of a good hearty gluten-free/ vegan menu! I love it when I get to visit my daughter at college! I not only look forward to seeing my daughter but also going to Gillys as much as possible! I wish we had a Gillys in our home town! The vegan buckwheat pancakes are my favorite and also the potatoes!!!! I had the french toast here today It was really good It was made with a soft french baguette so it was a little bit different Service was good too I love the live music and outdoor seating! Food is either good or great so you never have to worry! All of my friends are always wary about going but once they do they are always asking to go again I went to Gillie\&#39;s with my buddy when I was visiting him in Blacksburg recently He suggested it as a good place to grab breakfast and I\&#39;m so glad that he didIt has a cool college town vibe to it (including the mostly vegetarian and vegan inspired menu) and getting to sit outside on a beautiful Saturday morning is always a plusThere\&#39;s no meat on the breakfast menu at Gillies but for me that was no problem I got the Red Earth which was two scrambled eggs on a bed of potato\&#39;s topped with fresh salsa and served with an airy homemade buttermilk biscuit A filling meal to say the least it was flavorful and fresh without being too much foodI can see how this place would be a popular joint with the Virginia Tech students when class is in session an excellent array of interesting food at an affordable price tag that left me satisfied and ready to take on the day Gillie\&#39;s is THE brunch place in Blacksburg However you have to check out their lunch and dinner options if you have the chance; it\&#39;s all amazing and I\&#39;d argue that the dinner options are better You will forget that this place is vegetarian/pescetarian and don\&#39;t let the hippie vibe turn you off My dad is the biggest red meat eater and hippie-basher on the planet and very reluctantly entered the restaurant with me but he was so impressed by their brunch that he suggested we come back for dinner on his next visit - and he was even more impressed by that (I believe he had some sort of shrimp alfredo dish)Gillie\&#39;s often has local musical artists perform and there\&#39;s always art on the walls from someone in the area Additionally you\&#39;ll find various objects -- a Darth Vader figure a sewing machine a cat clock etc I get the feeling that having at least one tattoo or some other unusual look is mandatory for employees; in any case the employees are all interesting One of them (I\&#39;m not sure if he still works there) squats down on the floor and gets comfy while taking your orderBottom line: If you ask me where we should eat in Blacksburg I will say Gillie\&#39;s I stopped by Gillie\&#39;s for breakfast while in Blacksburg for some business I liked the variety of the breakfast menu and it was tough to pick just one thing - so I had a fewI had half an order of the French Toast and I was glad that I made that decision because half an order was still plenty of french toast for me It wasn\&#39;t the most amazing french toast I\&#39;ve ever had but it was goodI also ordered some fruit on the side and I was a bit disappointed in the blueberries - they didn\&#39;t seem fresh The juicer was also broken so I wasn\&#39;t able to taste the pear juice but I was able to get some orange juiceI won\&#39;t hold it against them that they don\&#39;t have the best part of breakfast (bacon) but that definitely would have made it better Bacon makes everything better If you\&#39;re okay with a bacon-less breakfast check out Gillie\&#39;s Atmosphere and Delicious FoodSome people complain about the service here but I haven\&#39;t had any issues in the 4 years I\&#39;ve eaten here I think their eclectic wait staff and decor are a nice touch for a vegetarian restaurant in a college townThere are MANY vegetarian options plus wine and beer selections They have delicious breads and desserts from their sister coffee shop Bollo\&#39;s Bakery I\&#39;ve had some of the most delicious salads soups and wraps I\&#39;ve had anywhere The Nut Sure salad is DE-LICIOUS!!! And my favorite wrap there is the Peanut Tofu Wrap with a side of chips and salsaAdditionally Gillie\&#39;s features a rotating show of artists on the walls of their fine establishment They also have live music weekly It\&#39;s a wonderful tie-in for a city so full of artists and musicians Gillie\&#39;s is one of the only places in the area to have exceptional vegetarian food It\&#39;s definitely out of the way for me but when given the chance I\&#39;ll never hesitate to drive the 45 minutes for their brunch or dinner I try to get something different every time (which is easy to do because of their wide variety of dishes) and I\&#39;ve yet to be disappointedIt\&#39;s also a great music venue I\&#39;ve been lucky enough to play here once and the staff was very accommodating and had great deals for bands It was very easy to book and the pay reflected the fact that we had to play for 2 hoursBasically I\&#39;ll recommend this place to anyone and everyone because it\&#39;s great and always a pleasant experience Gillie\&#39;s is definitely THE restaurant in Blacksburg that people flock to for brunch; it does get very crowded on the weekends (especially football game weekends) so I would advise to arrive early Yes it\&#39;s vegetarian but I promise that you won\&#39;t miss the meat at all! I\&#39;m a fan of the poached eggs florentine with smoked salmon for brunch but they also offer sweet options if that\&#39;s your cup-of-tea You MUST order their breakfast potatoes: they\&#39;re so perfectly seasoned and addicting However their biscuits are really not great (sorry I still love this place!)  They offer great dinner items too and you feel really healthy after you leave The South Meets Southwest (catfish with goat cheese grits/chipotle butter and arugula) was actually very light and satisfyingService is casual and can be somewhat flaky but that\&#39;s sort of the nature of this place; it\&#39;s local and I think the staff isn\&#39;t too concerned about turnover There\&#39;s live music on certain nights too! Gillie\&#39;s is an absolute gem in Blacksburg and a must whenever you\&#39;re in town Love love love the brunch here The atmosphere is very warm and welcoming the food is great the portion big and the servers make you feel welcoming and at home Not only that but the food comes out fast and fresh and delicious and they cater to vegetarians and vegans Service is excellent and overall the experience will brighten your day This is one of our favorite places for Sunday breakfast We\&#39;ve been happy with all the dishes we\&#39;ve had so farFrittata with veggies and balsamic vinaigrette made to order omelets buckwheat pancakes french toast and tofu scramble yum! Why 4 stars? Although the wait staff have always been friendly to us they are not always so friendly to customers I go here at least every other week for breakfast It is such a great selection of healthy breakfast/lunch/ and dinner foods My favorite items are the grits potatoes and Smoked Salmon! Great service there Only sad part is that they always seem to run out of something there when we go for breakfast (Spinach Mushrooms grits last time :-(  ) But all and all its the best breakfast in the VT area! Arguably one of the best places for brunch in all of Blacksburg Great atmosphere friendly service unique specials and great food They also support other local businesses! Gillies - quintessential stop for college students visiting parents and the hipsters that frequent this placeGillies is a vegetarian restaurant that serves fish although they are most notably known for their brunch With freshly made biscuits Tibetan prayer flags and shade grown coffee - the combination provides for a delicious brunch experienceThe banana walnut french toast consists of hearty pieces of thick french toast drizzled in a caramelized banana glaze topped with sweet walnuts and bananas The combination is impeccable The chappie\&#39;s choice is a mixture of fried potatoes with a strong flavor (I\&#39;ve always tasted curry powder in them) topped with scrambled eggs and white cheddar For the prices ($8 or less) it\&#39;s a great deal!The only problem I have with this place is the service or lack thereof The servers are often very inattentive and all over the place That\&#39;s what happens when the food has a great reputation - the service is lacklusterStill if you\&#39;re in Blacksburg this is definitely a place to go The food is delicious! Red Earth is a great breakfast heresalsa over eggs and their famous potatoes Very tasty place kind of holier-than-thou hipster but whatever They do not have bloody mary\&#39;s or mimosas here so expect to drink some of their yummy coffee or juice They have specials which is also niceThis place is a veggie place Meaning there is no meat Some reviewers talk about the fish but in my 11 years at Blacksburg I\&#39;ve never visited them when they offered fish and I\&#39;ve eaten there a lot Funny story my friend once brought bacon in her purse so she could eat bacon with her breakfast The waitstaff had a conniption They were so dramatic and declared they would now have to &#34;throw the plate away&#34; Really? Then when she did not leave a large tip the waiter chased her down the street complainingSo the moral of the story is do not allow friends to BYOB (Bring your own bacon)??? Cleverly assembled vegetarian dishes with quality ingredients including freshly baked breads Great brunch options both sweet and savory good-looking dinner options (I\&#39;ve never actually eaten dinner here though I\&#39;ve been here with friends as they ate during a live music performance) It\&#39;s nice place to escape from the undergrads on a Friday night as they host interesting and variable music acts Excellent vegan brunch (not that I am vegan) Amazing pancakes eggs home fries oatmeal French toast and coffee Be prepared to wait but it is worth it Very friendly service too Thought the food was average I had the catfish very small portion it was tasty though They basically fill you up with sides Wife thought her blackbean burger was good Service was terrible Had a new guy that was obviously turned loose WAY to soon Can\&#39;t blame the server we blame the owner / manager for lack of training Ok first thing first Yeah it say vegetarian and the place is a bit hippy/trippy but don\&#39;t let it discourage you This place has a line at the door for a reason I am a rampant carnivore with canines that get exercised regularly so when I say that the scrambled eggs potatoes and buttermilk biscuits more than make up for the lack of red meat The plate was the size of a frisbee it was laden with fluffy scrambled eggs with white cheddar drizzle It was crowned atop a bet of home fry potatoes with spices Top that with coffee and a buttermilk biscuit All that times two for two for less than twenty bucks Go Hokies! Gillie\&#39;s never let\&#39;s me down This is our go to for a feel good breakfast that will always please Banana Walnut French Toast &amp; Gillie\&#39;s Potatoes are my go-to But the specials will generally knock your socks offMy big tip get up early (if you can) be at the door when it opens and don\&#39;t wait in the cold with the throngs of others on the weekends Unlikely to find a better veggie brunch place in the country  let alone Blacksburg I was a regular for 5 years The Gillies special and the fresh juices are a must have I love this place While well known for its weekend breakfasts you must also try the salads Sandwiches And dinners  Everyone is fresh made and delectable Would love to say the food is greatbut after calling to make sure we could make breakfast we showed up 25 minutes before the end of the breakfast shift and were told &#34;sorry we can\&#39;t serve you&#34; Of all the places we have been in Blacksburg this is the first that had such horrible service and lack of small town congeniality But being we will be moving here and having guests every weekend for football games luckily there are plenty of places where we can take our business Sorry Gillie\&#39;s you missed out on what could have been 4 years of loyal customers weekly Went on a Saturday around noon to try brunchnot very crowded but service was very slow No refills of water had to get up to get coffee from the servers busy eating drinking and talking to pay much attention to us Waited 15 minutes for a check finally got up to find that too Huevos rancheros were ok but not good enough to overcome the lack of service Their brunch is delicious and the place is always packed for that time but it\&#39;s worth the wait I love their french toast However after 2pm when brunch ends the place is always dark and deserted I think their vegetarian menu scares away customers after brunch So go before 2pm! My husband and I stopped here on the recommendation of a friend We were in town on business and this was actually my first time visiting Blacksburg! I was so excited to try Gillies after my friend hyped it up and it definitely lived up to all of my expectations!We came for breakfast and it was PACKED but it didn\&#39;t take long to get a table I had a breakfast bowl with eggs potatoes salsa and cheese The salsa was a little too tomatoey and acidic for my taste but I thought the potatoes were absolutely perfect The biscuit that came with it was also amazing! It was huge and fluffy My husband had an omelette which I tried and that was also delicious If we ever make it back I\&#39;ll definitely have to try that! A well-located restaurant with nice wait staff We had some very good pancakes and French toast while there However I can\&#39;t really buy into the hype The food service and venue were just okay What an incredible place! Intimate setting and an amazing find for vegetarians or anyone who cares about eating right Our server was exceptional - knew everything about everything on the menu which really helped us make a decision My son (14) was hesitant to try \&#39;new\&#39; things - but scarfed down his chili cheese quesadilla without blinking LOVE the red cabbage side He loved the orange creme soda This place is as old as the hills but feels newer than almost anywhere I\&#39;ve ever dined LOVE it Love this place! Breakfast lunch dinner are all amazing Consistently wonderful food! This was a great find! I was in town just for the night and came across this place - what a treat!  I ate with three other people - and everyone enjoyed their meal I had the Tofu Gado-Gado which was delicious - tofu in a peanut sauce with thai basil jasmine rice and veggies  Husband got the catfish and cheddar grits which made him very happy Our waitress was super nice and helpful and we even chatted a bit with chefs behind the line I love an open kitchen!Only thing is they close so early ! We shut down the place at barely 10 PM One of the best breakfasts I\&#39;ve ever had I live everything about this place The vibe the decor the food the service Veggies never tasted so good! If it weren\&#39;t for our commitment to eat some place new each time I come to Blacksburg I would have breakfast here every time I visit Good food good atmosphere but coffee disappointing considering the efforts made towards such a forward thinking menu Great brunch and equally delicious lunch/dinner menu!I love eating at vegetarian/vegan restaurants because there\&#39;s no question of asking the waiter to run through every ingredient of a dish to make sure there is no meat in it Gillie\&#39;s food is fresh and hearty! I recommended it 100% to anyone who lives here or is visiting the area The only reason I give it 4 stars is because they are always short-handed in staff It\&#39;s not only just during the busy times but I\&#39;ve noticed even when things are slow each waiter is serving too many tables and always get something wrong or misses something I had the quinoa and chick pea burger and the eggplant curry soup Both were terrific Staff was friendly and efficient I will go again Ok coffee decent tofu scramblehowever it\&#39;s the first time I\&#39;ve had tofu scramble where the tofu is in cubes vs actually scrambled It tasted more like an Asian stir fry than the tofu scramble I am used to The decor was nice and the food seemed to be of good quality Best breakfast in Blacksburg No best breakfast in southwestern Virginia! I dream of going back to Blacksburg and nomming here before a football game Try the burrito Uuhhhh like an orgy on my face So good B-burg is awesome sauce and this place has some of that awesome sauceI went here twice in one weekend Gillie\&#39;s lunches are the best -- I *always* get a special It\&#39;s usually veg\&#39;d comfort food Breakfasts are always busy but also great When I have visitors in B\&#39;burg I take them to Gillie\&#39;s Great food great service good music Eggs florentine was fantastic! Fresh ingredients highly recommend This is truly a local gem - they use veggies from local farms and bread from a bakery around the corner Nearly everything on the menu can be ordered vegan and/or gluten free I had the supreme burrito and was not disappointed The only reason I am not giving this establishment five stars is the amount of time I had to wait for my food to come out We stopped into Gillies for breakfast while visiting the Virginia Tech campus for freshman orientation and the food was delicious! The menu has some unusual options not just your every day breakfast offerings which was nice I had the red earth which is scrambled eggs over breakfast potatoes and covered in salsa The biscuit that came with my eggs was outstanding Light and fluffy and a mile high and the salsa on my eggs was obviously made fresh in house Their breakfast potatoes are very good and our service was excellent Another bonus if you ask for hot sauce it\&#39;s sriracha! There was a LOT of salsa on my egss but other than that everything was great! Going on a college visit to VaTech on a very cold day so needed a hearty breakfast and Gillies fit the bill I got the French toast - 5 half slices of thick cinnamon/slight taste of vanilla goodness Added a side of very tasty hashbrowns Tried the iced berry zinger tea It was ok I think it\&#39;s an acquired taste The Mrs got the 122 special which was fine for her My son raved about the Gillie\&#39;s Special It was good comfort food nice melted cheese and fluffy eggs topped nicely with fresh salsa My daughter wanted a smaller dish so she ordered the silver dollar pancakes Actually they were 2 fairly thick regular sized pancakes She ordered fresh squeezed apple juice - when they say fresh squeezed they really mean it The restaurant had a unique ambiance - wood all over young talkative staff &amp; lots of energyWe all agreed if we had the chance we would definitely go back again I have friends that LOVE Gillies I\&#39;ve been here six or seven times mostly for breakfast or brunch Service is not a highlight Food is OK but really variable (same thing ordered twice in 2 weeks came out very different) Location is good assuming you\&#39;re walking or have a University parking pass Frankly I prefer Waffle House but you won\&#39;t get groovy vegetarian food there Heard breakfast was great so we went for dinner and it was just OK My sis liked her salmon &amp; her fiance liked his salmon pasta dish but my soba noodles were just OK I\&#39;ll try it again but pick something else By far the best breakfast/brunch in all of Blacksburg Reasonably priced and great quality food!Lunch is decent as well but dinner is just okay There\&#39;s absolutely NOTHING wrong with Gillies but while breakfast there is OUTSTANDING the rest is just alright Whatever they have there as a special is usually awesome They cook with fresh ingredients and everything tastes great They also have a large juicer and can make you a juice from fresh fruits (never frozen) If you want to have bread soaked in oil just order one of their vegeterian dishes I have never had such a greasy meal before Gillie\&#39;s is best known for their breakfast and live music It is all vegetarian but with some fish options For breakfast since I am not a huge egg person I typically get the Salmon Bruschetta which is very good It still upsets my boyfriend that Gillies does not serve REAL maple syrup Gillies skimps on a lot of the little details - such as jams in store-bought packets and &#34;fresh squeezed orange juice&#34; served cold (?)I think Gillies should really try to be almost completely locally sourced food rather than just offering (currently) local spinach from Greenstar Farms I am pretty sure most of their clientele would appreciate the shift and be happy to pay a bit more for a truly &#34;local&#34; experienceService is hit or miss some are great some are off-putting I am thankful to have Gillies though because there are not many other decent places within walking distance of campus! I just think they could do betterFavorites: Soups of the day Salmon Bruschetta and the Seitan Mushroom Burger Gillies had the best vegetarian chili I have ever eaten The veggie melt was good but difficult to consume due to its bulk Great friendly service! This was my first time here but I\&#39;ll be back whenever I\&#39;m in the area As a dedicated omnivore I don\&#39;t go to many vegetarian restaurants but we had a veggie friend in town so we decided to take one for the team HOLY MOTHER OF GOD Everything about this place is amazing Unexpectedly delicious flavor combinations and perfectly prepared food Fantastic service from friendly people Great atmosphere I loved everything and will be back even without my vegetarian escort A solid place to eat in BBurg For breakfast I recommend the Red EarthFor dinner the catfish is nice and today they had a special with seitan &amp; penne -- called the Babylon Yummy brunch place They also have mimosa which is one of the best you can get Cozy atmosphere with students as well as families and would definitely recommend it Do check it out I know the reputation is for breakfast but my husband and I decided to give dinner a shot and oh my lord it was delicious! All options are full of flavor and so filling Tofu was cooked thoroughly but well marinated Sauces weren\&#39;t overpowering Gillie\&#39;s (pronounced with a G not a J sound) is vegetarian with fish  I always find this to be an oxymoron  However I am glad that Gillie\&#39;s also does fish because it fits I\&#39;ve mainly gone for breakfasts but I know their lunches are also super yummy Gillie\&#39;s makes everything fresh so they remind you that your food might take some time to prepare Also they run out of the fresh squeezed orange juice pretty fast during a weekend morning On top of that it\&#39;s a small place so you might have to wait a little while for a table Luckily the food is usually worth waiting for The food is fresh most breakfast dishes are served with their form of potatoes (kind of spicy home fries that are super yummy) and a biscuit (much to my horror because I hate biscuits) I know people that would kill for the french toast (made with either baguette or whole grain bread) but I prefer their omelets They are made with three eggs and automatically come with white cheddar on them Yesterday I had what sounds like a dangerous combination but turned out to be the best omelet I\&#39;ve ever eaten: feta fresh spinach artichoke hearts and smoked salmonThey also own Bollo\&#39;s coffee shop around the corner and the two share a bakery This means you will often see a large tray full of freshly baked bread walking down the street between the two restaurants I always think that\&#39;s neat If you\&#39;re visiting Virginia Tech walk the block from campus and go here for breakfast It\&#39;s worth it Been here twice Food and service are both fantastic Breakfasts never seem to be all that healthy At gillies you get healthy and yummy I came here for breakfast with my room mates because I have heard so many good things about it and was definitely not disappointedI ordered the 850 Eldorado Omelet with spinach artichoke and onion and one of room mates ordered the salmon bruschetta We split both evenly amongst ourselvesThe omelete was amazing! it was fluffy flavorful cooked to perfection and whatever cheese they used was also melty and delicious The biscuit was a little on the dry side that morning but the potatoes were on point I don\&#39;t understand what made the potatoes so delicious but they were like crack---addictingThe salmon bruschetta was also delicious I definitely recommend itThe restaurant itself was VERY busy It took a while for our orders to be taken because they were packed and there were only two servers that also worked as bussers but once we ordered it did not take too long for the food to come out (10-15 minutes?)All in all it was a great experience and I cannot wait to go back for that bruschetta! Yum Banana walnut French toast and fresh orange juice My cup was chipped but the waiters were nice and would replace it right away Hands down the best breakfast in town The 850 is great as are the beans and grits You can\&#39;t go wrong with any of their omelets French toast or pancakes And their potatoes are pretty good too The staff is almost always friendly and attentive Don\&#39;t let the vegetarian/vegan label discourage you it\&#39;s good food period O Gillie\&#39;s how I love theeGillie\&#39;s has the best breakfast in Blacksburg possibly in the entire NRV One semester I went there for breakfast every Monday after my 8 AM lecture I usually had the Molletes and the iced herbal tea but sometimes I switched it up and got the Gillie\&#39;s Special with tofu instead of eggs It was all delicious They serve mostly vegetarian food with some seafood and you can substitute tofu and/or soy cheese to make many dishes vegan There\&#39;s brunch on the weekends served til early afternoon If you go during brunch expect to wait for a table--sometimes we\&#39;ve waited up to an hour Don\&#39;t worry it\&#39;s worth it BRUNCH! usually a long wait but totally worth it Quinoa chick pea burger Tofu Reuben and vegan chili were awesome! Amazing flavors and good friendly service Great lunch stop!!! A must visit! Whether you need to satisfy your breakfast cravings or just to stare at hipsters Gillie\&#39;s is the place to go I always get the 850 Eldorado Omelette which is sort of a weird menu item because it\&#39;s really just a standard omelette with your choice of 3 fillings so I don\&#39;t really know what it makes it an &#34;850 Eldorado Omelette&#34; as opposed to just you know an omelette but it\&#39;s a pretty kickass omelette so maybe that\&#39;s why Their dinners are actually really good too and it\&#39;s funny that people don\&#39;t seem to go there as much for dinner as they do for breakfast I love their blackberry-glazed salmon and their stir-fries can be pretty decent as wellThe service is usually a little &#34;meh&#34; but it just depends- I\&#39;ve had great servers and not-so-great ones (the not-so-great ones usually look a little stoned or coked out so that might explain it) Either way Blacksburg restaurant service is never something to write home about so you get kinda used to it Go to Gillie\&#39;s Get the omelette or salmon Make friends with a hipster The End I was turned off by this place when I found out It was a veggie joint but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was I had the salmon hash during their brunch hours and I have to say it was pretty delicious The service was really good the staff were very friendly and I will go back for more I should have gone there earlier I finally went to Gillie\&#39;s the day I was leaving Blacksburg for breakfast The place was completely PACKED so it\&#39;s a very popular breakfast joint It was also a construction zone when I went so somewhere like 1/4 of the seating couldn\&#39;t be used It was frustrating There wasn\&#39;t much communication as to how long the wait would be and there really wasn\&#39;t anywhere to wait so it was strange I didn\&#39;t realize it was a vegan/vegetarian place until we got there You definitely pay for that The food was good The belgian waffle was good The stuffed french toast was good Being a meatatarian I just wish they had bacon or sausage but certainly understand why they didn\&#39;t There were only two or so really small tables outside so the outdoor seating isn\&#39;t much Fantastic breakfast Banana nut french toast is the way to go Really good coffee as well We had dinner here the food was excellent including my wife\&#39;s salmon with blackberry glaze which she says was delicious The service was not all that great however the waitress was quite absent and spent most of her time standing behind the counter looking bored She lost out on selling a few more drinks because of it and I tipped accordingly Happy she did not chase me down the street as some of the posts indicate! Evidently one of the best places in Blacksburg Their brunch is superb but it\&#39;s also definitely worth trying out their lunch and dinner options Their crunchy tofu is life changing and they have fresh pressed juice which is a huge plus People highly recommend their Red Earth brunch but I\&#39;m not the biggest fan In terms of brunch their soysages are amazing and their banana walnut french toast You\&#39;ll forget that this is even a vegetarian restaurant Horrible experience went for breakfast on a Saturday morning No sugar free drink options didn\&#39;t refill ice in water glass had multiple refills of warm water They ran out of biscuits which one came with the meal I got so I asked if they can sub in a single pancake was told it would be fine was up-charged for it later Ordered an omelet with minced garlic someone needs to show the cook what minced garlic looks like cause the chunks of garlic in my omelet were the size of dimes (no joke) All in all will have to drag me back into that place Their brunch is amazing I got an omlette My father got pancakes which were amazing But be ready to face long wait times I love this place for breakfast The French toast with walnuts and bananas is amazing The omelets are fantastic and the potatoes are to die forI never thought I\&#39;d be such a fan of a vegetarian restaurant but Gillie\&#39;s is awesome!Gillie\&#39;s frequently has live music in the evenings and is a great place to chill out and relax Everyone raves about Gillie\&#39;s for breakfast but I\&#39;ve only been for dinner which I can only guess is just as great This place is a gem for those with alternative diets vegan and vegetarian dishes as well as seafood but don\&#39;t think for a second if you usually eat meat that you won\&#39;t enjoy the food here! The restaurant even sells natural drinks and sodas which you won\&#39;t find many other places and their desserts come from a local shop down the street I took my sister in for breakfast this past weekend while visiting I had heard such good things about Gillies but we were so disappointed The eggs and French toast were okay and the potatoes very good But the so called &#34;fresh&#34; salsa was clearly made with canned stewed tomatoes It was so gross that I scraped it all off The service was as appalling as my canned salsa The waitresses were snippy inattentive and ours literally threw creamer at us when we asked for it I realize it\&#39;s sort of a hippy hang out but maybe the waitresses should shave their underarms if they want to wear tank tops and handle food Feeling lazyBottom Line: Don\&#39;t bother coming here unless it\&#39;s for breakfast/brunch Every time I come here I order an omelette (it\&#39;s made with 3 whole eggs and stuffed full of 3 choices of fillings or you could get one off the menu) and it comes loaded with a heaping pile of crunchy-on-the-outside chewy-on-the-inside delicious hash browns and the largest biscuit I have ever had in my life (come early or they run out of biscuits and give you honey texas toast the biscuit was huge like about the size of a softball) All of that is about $8-9 a bargain if you consider how high-quality the ingredients that go into the food are and how wonderfully and exact it\&#39;s preparedGo there in the morning when you\&#39;re hungover the hash browns alone will cure you I have been repeatedly disappointed in this place The quality of the food is up and down Getting a hot cup of tea is a challenge One time the sauce on my eggs tasted bottled Another time the vegetable stir fry was way over done and saltedI have experienced so much better vegetarian food around the country so I have to say they would benefit from a relook at the food and a redo of many of their recipes This gets a five star on some menu items but the service is bitchy sometimes You have to be alert; you never know when PMS is in this joint So if you are tolerant of rudeness at random times and peace love and freedom at othersthe food is awesome! Go for the whole wheat banana french toast or the Chappie\&#39;\&#39;s! Ohand don\&#39;t ask for meat or you ask for them to bitch Read the signvegetarian folks ;-) When we go to visit our daughter at Virginia Tech this is always a must go to for breakfast My favorite dish is the banana walnut French toast I love this dish It\&#39;s reasonable priced with plenty to eat and always delicious Everything is fresh If you\&#39;ve never been here before get up early or you\&#39;ll have to wait for your turn to sit After you eat you\&#39;ll know why and you feel like it was worth the wait Enjoy! Simple food done right Very vegetarian friendly I love the homemade black bean burgers I have come here for yearsI do wish the sides matched the sandwichesmaybe homemade chips? One of my all around favorites in Blacksburg! Nice welcoming atmosphere really hearty and healthy food that is usually really delicious! The brunch is my favorite in town love the smoked salmon bruschetta and the omelets and breakfast burritos are usually really yummy The catfish sub is a winner as is their red coleslaw with the nice hint of sesame oil Just a comfy place that feels a lot like home cooking Can get overly crowded for Sunday brunchespecially a pain when the students are all still around but that\&#39;s not their faulta real treat in the summer though! I really wanted some poached eggs but it guess they stop serving breakfast relatively early for me (10 I think) Such a bummer since it seems like this place shines above all others in the brunch department I decided on some pasta dish and it was okay The garlic bread was hard as a rock Good service if you don\&#39;t mind hipsters I would probably go back earlier and have something else Pretty good breakfast though you\&#39;ll have to wait to get a table and they always run out of grits early on the weekends What\&#39;s so hard about stocking up on grits when you run out every weekend? I feel like a regular at this point and yet this is my first time reviewing this fine establishment Gillies has a fantastic breakfast/brunch menu that has never disappointed me nor the out of towners that I have brought time and time again The juevos racheros have become my go to seeing as I am a fan of spicy things and it brings together many great simple flavors to become the perfect brunch dish The only reason this isn\&#39;t a 5 star rating for me is the lack of meat in house and I know I know if you don\&#39;t like how we do things &#34;Get the F out of here&#34; but aside from that it is the go to breakfast/brunch place in Blacksburg On a visit from California I was excited to finally eat at the legendary Gillie\&#39;s My boyfriend a Virginia Tech alum frequented this restaurant on a weekly basis when he was a student and I had heard so much about it Gillie\&#39;s is a no-frills casual vegetarian restaurant with reasonable prices plenty of variety and good foodWe ate the nachos and the tofu reuben The nachos consisted of a heaping plate of tortilla chips melted cheese black olives black beans and kidney beans tomatoes red peppers and sour cream It is large enough to share and makes a wonderful appetizer or meal The tofu reuben was phenomenal- a marinated slice of tofu sauerkraut and russian dressing sandwiched between two slices of homemade rye bread The sandwich is served with a red cabbage and carrot slaw lightly dressed in a sesame oil My boyfriend has eaten his fair share of tofu reubens and he says that the one at Gillie\&#39;s is simply the best     I can see why my boyfriend was a Gillie\&#39;s regular while he was at Virginia Tech We are headed back to California tomorrow but already I can\&#39;t wait until we return to Virginia so we can eat at Gillie\&#39;s again My family and I had brunch here a couple days ago when we went down to drop my sister off at Tech I had never been to Gillies during my own four years as a student at Tech so it wasn\&#39;t even on my list of places to eat We had originally planned on just going to iHop for a quick breakfast but then I saw the great reviews Gillie\&#39;s had on Yelp so we decided to give it a try Everyone was VERY happy with the food service and coffee Although it was a Saturday morning we luckily didn\&#39;t have to wait too long for our party of 3 to be seated My mom and sister each ordered an omelet with the breakfast potatoes The omelet was absolutely amazing and the breakfast potatoes were super addictive The biscuits that came with their meals however were so-so I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;d order them separately I got the Spanish Frittata and it was AMAZING The combination of feta potatoes black olives Mmmmm! Delicious! We also ordered a plate of pancakes (not realizing how huge the portions are) The pancakes were huge and very fluffy I am definitely looking forward to going back when I go to visit my sister! This is a great place to eat if you are a fan of vegetarian or vegan meals You don\&#39;t have to be either to like the atmosphere and food I have been there for lunch and dinner and can not wait to go for breakfast Good as it gets in Blacksburg Not a fan of the breakfast which is what most people seem to love Adventures lunch and dinner options with daily specials--great Tofu and coconut burger special was yum; the seitan burger is also wonderful The Moroccan seitan is also a winner (although not very Moroccan that I can tell?) My favorite is the cajun alfredo dish Gillies is occasionally uneven (perhaps the price you pay for fresh food in a college town) The first time I had the Basin Street the pasta was literally black and gritty with cajun spice I was astonished; I am a southwestern girl who almost never finds anything spicy out in the southeast The next time I ordered light spice; I couldn\&#39;t taste the cajun seasonings at all and amped it up with my own homemade spice mix (thanks Emeril) I think Basin Street is normally pretty mild--the first time I had it the cook must have accidentally dropped extra onto my serving or something Serving sizes seem to vary tooThe wine selection could use a little help but it is affordable so I can\&#39;t complain I also wish they\&#39;d avoid fish a bit more for vegetarians who aren\&#39;t doing the fish thing Also I\&#39;ve heard concerns about cleanliness? Gosh I hope they aren\&#39;t trueEven if you aren\&#39;t a vegetarian you will love Gillies if you have a more adventurous palate Only thing to avoid is the salsa (tastes like weird gazpachoblah)Be sure to order dessert If you don\&#39;t like the selection walk around the corner to Bollo\&#39;s for more options My husband and I did not have the best experience when we ventured to Gillie\&#39;s for breakfast one football weekend Although they were very busy service was quite good The coffee and freshly-made juices were also good though we would have loved espresso as an option The worst part was the food My breakfast burrito was a sloppy mess - not enough eggs too many beans and just overall too wet My husband\&#39;s huevo rancheros was also poorly executed - served on a bed of tortilla chips rather than on toasted bread or something more appetizing Also I realize this is a vegetarian restaurant but really no soy sausage options? That\&#39;s pretty ridiculous We may give them another shot since there are so few options for breakfast in Blacksburg They just would not be our first choice by any means First visit had scrambles eggs with cheese and fresh spinach Very good! Plenty of fresh coffee I\&#39;ll be back! I love this place I used to go here all the time when I was a student but now I still try to stop by whenever I go through the area They have awesome vegetarian cuisine and you don\&#39;t have to be vegan or a vegetarian to enjoy it It can get crowded and sometimes you will have to wait for a table but it\&#39;s worth it I like the atmosphere here Nothing fancy just down to earth people serving vegetarian foodThe quality of what you get here depends on when you go Gillie\&#39;s is known for it\&#39;s brunch which is pretty good but you often wait a while unless you get there early I personally like the french toast (made with baguette slices) or the molletes which are baguette toasts topped with spicy beans tomato and melted cheese Lunch and dinner are a little bit more hit-or-miss You can get some pretty good entrees but they\&#39;re highly variable The fish is generally pretty good but a bit expensive The one thing that is always consistently good is the beer selection They have a wide-variety of local and imported beer many of which are hard to find in other restaurants Not sure why this place always gets high marks But I will say I\&#39;ve only been once and it was enough to never make me go backI went for brunch one weekend The table I was seated at was dirty It did not get cleaned off The place was no where near packed but service was horrible The waitress wouldn\&#39;t refill my water When she finally did she gave me warm water from the tap I had to ask for more ice and she literally gave me one piece which melted instantly in the warm water  My silverware was dirty I found a hair in my eggs which were cold And the whole experience took about 1 hour and a half! I could never bring myself to go back to this place Best veggie burger I\&#39;ve had in years on the best bread I\&#39;ve possibly ever had I only wish they had French fries too When I rushed in from the snow to Gillie\&#39;s I felt warmer instantly because the place was full of happy faces delicious smells and friendly chatter It was very crowded and every table was filled or just vacated There were only two servers covering all the tables the bar the register and doing their own bussing so service was slow but they seemed to be keeping their chins up despite the rush I was booked to play music which is why I was there and so I set up in the window by the front door I think some bands might have a good time playing here and a lot of the people seemed happy that there was music but really it\&#39;s not conducive to really paying attention to song-lyrics There is just too much talking and clinking of knives and forks and the sound from the kitchen carries all the way across the restaurant But still I was grateful for the folks who made a point to sit up front have a couple of drinks listen to some songs and buy a CD And for the tip envelopes right on each table It was nice at the end of the night to find that all the diners had appreciated me!After the gig I chose a bottle from the great beer selection and ordered Nori-crusted tofu with a soba noodle cake and wasabi aoili that was excelent I think there was a vegetable with it but I can\&#39;t remember now Super-yummy though The woman I was staying with suggested that Gillie\&#39;s was the best place in town for breakfast so we went back the next day Again only 2 servers rushing around the place and it took us quite a while to get coffee But I ordered the Frittata with feta artichoke hearts spinach potatoes tomatoes and olives I got an extra biscuit on the side thinking eggs and veggies wouldn\&#39;t be enough I was expecting all those toppings to be cooking inside the eggs but instead it was served almost like a pizza with an omelette for the crust melted jack cheese and then fresh veggies all over the top Soooo good It was huge and definitely would have been enough to eat on it\&#39;s own so don\&#39;t feel that you need to order toast Everyone I ate with suggested other favorite dishes so I hope I get to go back and sample something else next time! This is the place to go if you need tasty light food Their pita pizzas are excellent in the afternoon Try out their specials for dinnerI especially love their breakfast on the weekends Specifically the potatoes with cheese and banana honey wheat french toast Truly delicious vegetarian fare in a world where meat reigns supreme (the South)Went here simply because I was visiting VT and every other place nearby was a \&#39;bar and grill\&#39; or crappy sandwich chain (subway-types) Expected mediocre food but was pleasantly surprised The burger which was a mushroom-seitan-grain patty was awesome and the perfect texture The bun was really good too a multi-grain one I assume and was perfectly toasted providing a great textural combination with the patty Herbed mayo was on it but I saw the salad dressings on the menu and got a side of lemon-tahini which I added to the sandwich Also has a mixed green salad which contained many fresh lettuces and veggies and a bowl of the chickpea-squash (butternut?) soup which was also good Really nice to be able to order carrot juice as I downed the whole thing while waiting for my food This place is a godsend in the Virginia countryside and a true gem for all the conscious eaters going to Tech Granted most students are probably meat-and-potatoes eaters but with more and more college kids going vegetarian it\&#39;s just really nice to have veggie food of this quality out in Blacksburg which to me seems like the middle of nowhere (no offense) I live in the Bay Area CA the self proclaimed mecca of vegetarian eating and this place could stand up against the best of them If you are a Tech student and at all concerned about healthy eating go here If not go get some wings or other pub fare at one of the generic grills around the cornerNice going guys Just stopped in Gillie\&#39;s asked if they had ice cream and received a smart-assed response from the hipster waiter who dealt with us- get a life moron! Management of Gillies should remind wait staff that customers matter- food is not good enough to put up with attitude! At last Friday I went to this restaurant with my two classmates While I got in to the door the waiter told us to find the any free table to sit in me and my friends were choosing the big square table in the corner After a long time one waiter came to us and asked us what to drink and gave the menu to us We spent a little bit time to figure out what to eat and I choose the burger and daily soup with mushroom I founded that there are some vegetarian food in almost every category It took maybe ten minutes until all the food is ready and the waiter delivered to us The burger is delicious and what I like is the dressing I looked around and founded that every burger had the same salad as the dressing The soup was also delicious Also the amount of the food is enough for me My classmates order the BBQ pizza and one I can\&#39;t figure out the name The pizza is salty than normally in other restaurant They had the shrimp on the every pieces of the pizza and the cheese was delicious As for the services it always took a long time for them to help us and we have to ask waiter and then they will come My friends ordered a cup of juice but they gave to her after we done for the food In general this restaurant is nice I like the picture on the wall and the decorations and also it is located at the downtown next to the campus The food is good and the atmosphere is nice for people come with friends Gillie\&#39;s is a Blacksburg staple It\&#39;s casual and eclectic Sometimes the service is great Sometimes it\&#39;s not so great The food however is usually very very good Breakfast is fantastic and their little outside tables are great for people-watching I love their flavored iced tea too! The food and atmosphere here were absolutely great It was indeed all that the folks said it would be like I had my first real &#34;southern grits&#34; here and it was surprisingly pleasant to eat especially with a lot of butter! I also had a spinach and cheese omellete that was very well prepared My only grip is that the place was packed It was Sunday morning brunch so it was no surprise So my party had to be wedged in the back The food was good but after I paid for brunch the waitress came out blatantly asked in front of multiple friends If I meant to pay only 10% I was completely Facebookstunned and didn\&#39;t know how to respond She then ushered me in and told me that I needed to double my tip which would make it 20% I did not think that the service of taking an order and refilling coffee cups was worth 20% so i tipped as I saw fit understand that waitresses make less than minimum wage but do NOT tell me how much I need to tip as tipping is something based on a level of service and worked performed and is at the discretion of the consumer Had a blackened fish sandwich here that made the whole table jealous Very good food even for a carnivore like myself Only thing is the prices are a bit high for me Follies is good and unique semi-vegetarian cuisine I haven\&#39;t been there in a couple of months but they\&#39;ve always had th best breakfast in town Good biscuits good yogurt or scrambled eggs good potatoes but the coffee - not so much This last is surprising since the same people own a nice coffee shopService is okay but variable I\&#39;ve never had an insulting waitress though in all my 15 plus years of eating there The reviewers who complain about insulting service and bad food must have a hidden agenda Cleanliness is just fine Believe me I\&#39;ve seen way worse (Sycamore)The atmosphere is college liberal which is what you\&#39;d expect in Blacksburg at a veggie restaurant Again the peoplebwho didn\&#39;t like this must have a hidden or neocon agenda We don\&#39;re need them though do we? NO!So very good breakfast served a relaxed paceDinner I\&#39;ve had here @ five times It costs much Kremlin but has always been very good It\&#39;s been a few years so I can\&#39;t rate them on itOverall four stars for very good food and the best biscuits in townPrice is good if you keep to simple fair such as the 122 with tofu Very bad service and unprofessional attitude toward a female when someone bullied a female there from his fear of consequences for his own problems One of my two favorite spots in Bburg For breakfast I get the red earth (thanks to a recommendation from Pastor Stan) DinnerFor dinner I enjoyed the Moroccan Seitan NapoleonThe Gado-Gado is okay but I\&#39;m a little biased since I lived in SE Asia My husband and I stopped at Gillie\&#39;s for breakfast while on a road trip Before I come off as a whiny vegan let me first say that I\&#39;m always grateful for restaurants that offer vegan options We were really happy to see several breakfast options marked as &#34;can be made animal free&#34;  I was immediately bummed to find out there wasn\&#39;t a vegan grits option or pancake option (so damn easy to make vegan) but we pressed on Husband ordered the tofu scramble with home fries and soy milk and I got a veganized version of some other thing that ended up looking exactly like my husband\&#39;s dish but with just cubed tofu  What bummed me out was the only vegan bread they offered was dry toasted baguette slices It seems like if you\&#39;re going to specifically tout yourself as having vegan options at least keep some vegan margarine on hand so us vegans don\&#39;t have to nibble on dry white bread The tofu &#34;scramble&#34; (actually cubed not scrambled but I know this can be a regional thing) was pretty good all slathered in BBQ sauce The home fries were absolutely perfect Super greasy and really awesome We were brought room temperature soy milk along with ice filled glasses The server told us that they didn\&#39;t have any soymilk in stock so they stepped out to get us some A nice gesture but I wonder why no soymilk? Not enough vegans in this college town?The service was friendly and our bellies were filled and ready for our 10 hour drive back home If I lived locally I probably wouldn\&#39;t be a regular at Gillie\&#39;s but it was a nice place to get a vegan bite while traveling I love Gillie\&#39;s!! This is hands-down my favorite restaurant in Blacksburg for a nice meal Their brunch is too good for words but I\&#39;ve been to dinner once too and it was amazing as well! Such an interesting selection of dishes that vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike can enjoy Just be warned: it takes a while to pick what you want from their extensive and mouth-watering menu :) Great vegetarian food at fair prices I\&#39;m no vegetarian and I love this place Their breakfast cannot be beat! Great breakfast and decent prices! Their specials on the weekends for brunch are the best but you have to get there early especially on football weekends! Their service used to be mediocre but it has gotten much better In the late 90s I started eating here at Gillie\&#39;s so often that I eventually applied for a job I stopped by at Gillies on a cross-country road trip about a year ago; I hadn\&#39;t been there since 2003 I was pleased to see the service is just as spotty and the food is just as good A Blacksburg landmark Breakfast is always a winner here Breakfast/brunch is vegetarian (vegan options) and generally on the greasy comfort food side Tofu can typically be substituted for eggs Expect a long wait and chaotic service on weekends as this place gets packed My breakfast favorite is the red earth - eggs (or tofu) on potatoes with salsa The quality of lunch depends on who is cooking but there are always lots of options The veggie chili is what got me hooked on Gillies best in a fresh bread bowl made next door Lunch usually has seafood options here and there This is really the time of day when Gillies becomes a hangoutDinner is laid back nice music and an expanded lunch menu plus specials The cooks on dinner are usually quite good There is usually a seafood option This is definitely THE breakfast/brunch place to go to in downtown Blacksburg They serve up the best Belgian waffles and (from what I hear) have some good egg dishes as well but they are known to have a lot of vegetarian and vegan options within their menu It\&#39;s always warm and cozy inside Gillie\&#39;s so it is perfect for a comforting meal and escape on a frigid Blacksburg day It is always packed especially so on weekends though which is my only gripe about the place Excellent experience! We went for dinner while in Blacksburg VA the other night and enjoyed a wonderful dinner and excellent service Amazing food It was so good we went back the next morning for breakfast We ate at the bar and the service again was excellent Never had to ask for coffee or water I love this place and look forward to going again when in townMy only suggestionstaff should smile a bit more!Highly recommended! This is *the* go-to place for breakfast in Blacksburg On football weekends the wait is over an hour and still growing There are vegan options and they will vegan-ize almost anything on the menu My wife &amp; I stop here every time we visit my old stomping grounds and it\&#39;s not just for breakfast!It has a friendly warm atmosphere with live music most weekend nights - though its not usually a band - usually a guy with a guitar or something similar Very quite and apropos A friend of mine who is a student at Virginia Tech took me to Gillie\&#39;s I was skeptical at first because it is vegetarian and I have to eat meat in every meal They\&#39;re only open during breakfast/brunch hours so get there early because the wait is quite a whileWe all ordered the omelettes with your choice of 3 fillings I was expecting to not get full since it was vegetarian but I was wrong! I could barely get past half of it It was delicious moist and cooked perfectly! The bread that you get as a side is huge My friend\&#39;s salmon omelette was a very large portion so servings don\&#39;t disappoint I\&#39;d come back here for breakfast again Loved it!! Big thumbs up had an awesome breakfast while here from out of town Best breakfast in all of Blacksburg and a very non-vegetarian friendly menu for lunch and dinner Great prices and even better food Definitely my favorite restaurant in Blacksburg Who doesn\&#39;t love Gillie\&#39;s?? They have freshly squeezed apple juice and biscuits to die for!! Gillies will always be something I remember when I think of Blacksburg Their weekend brunches are a ritual to be shared each week It\&#39;s worth waiting 30 min for a table in the freezing cold in the middle of Blacksburg winters to get a seat in the funky-cozy chic hippie bustle of activity that are Gillie\&#39;s brunches I pretty much have the menu memorized and I could blabber on forever but you\&#39;ve gotta get the potatoes and a biscuit 122 is a good deal Have the Gillies Special or Huevos Rancheros and you don\&#39;t need to eat the rest of the day Also I always milk the free coffee refills it\&#39;s excellent (co-op ethically sourced shade grown organic Honduran coffee to be exact) Dinner is excellent If you need a place to take a date this is the best place in Blacksburg You\&#39;ll be able to have a conversation and the atmosphere is nice casual and can be romantic Don\&#39;t worry about it being vegetarian if you\&#39;re a meat eater they also offer seafood Gillies lunch is also an excellent option though not quite fast enough to pop in between classes Don\&#39;t miss out on their valentines day special You have to reserve it a few weeks in advance but you\&#39;ll be treated to a fixed-price menu of hands down the best food in Blacksburg If you ever want to challenge your stomach in the early morning just get any one of their incredibly killer omelets These beasts will fill you up and leave your wallet full! Food was bland I\&#39;d rather cook my own breakfast than eat their crap Been here several times Great stuff! It\&#39;s great that they serve seafood so I could take my parents there and everyone ordered something they wanted The food is creative without a hint of &#34;Hey let\&#39;s make wasabi parmigiano reggiano ice cream with sunflower sprout pesto and a drizzle of pickle juice reduction on a nest of tempura granola bars and see if it\&#39;s innovative enough to be cool!&#34; I don\&#39;t understand why everyone in town loves Gillie\&#39;s The food is OK but that\&#39;s only if the line cook in the back competent and paying attention When I go to a restaurant regularly I often end up getting a few favorite dishes a lot of the time At Gillies one out of three times I will get the scrambled tofu The last few times it was not eatable once it was burnt and another time it was burnt and they decided to put three times as much sauce to cover up the burnt taste It was terrible but it seems to be dependent on who they have cooking in the kitchen If the cook is good the food doesn\&#39;t take a hugely long time and the food is decent but if the cook isn\&#39;t your food will take forever (I\&#39;ve waited over an hour at lunch) and it will be bad It\&#39;s OK but nothing special One thing is for sure everything on your plate will be brown Consistently mediocre which is above average in Blacksburg My husband found a mop string baked into a biscuit he was served at breakfast Even the waitstaff was mortifiedbiting in and finding string sticking out Gross we all lost our appetites after that as you can imagine Aside from this I thought the food was ok priorbut question the cleanliness of the kitchen and why no ice in my water? It is hard for us to eat here after such a disgusting experience The Best Breakfast in Blacksburg yes Try the Red Earth!But they have delicious lunch and dinner items on their menu as wellI got an awesome peanut tofu dish for dinner and the veggie burritos are always consistently deliciousService can be iffy on crowded sunday mornings but whether you are coming for Breakfast Lunch or Dinner you will be guaranteed an awesome meal One of the best breakfast spots in Blacksburg I usually go on Sunday mornings - which means you have to get there while people are still in church After church is out the line spills out onto College Avenue I get the Chappie\&#39;s Choice every time Great breakfast Great food Neat atmosphere My fav for breakfast Heard lunch and dinner is good also Pescatarian with vegan and gluten free available Almost absolutely nothing local rarely organic Biscuits that could sink a battleship from the bakery around the corner which makes the most delicious garbanzo bean bread I have had yet (or at least they used to be-I got one the other day that couldn\&#39;t sink a bath toy) Craft and local beer Music for all kinds Great service Food can surprise and disappoint You will find something you like Three services Minimal patio Get to the bar stool early on the weekends to secure your post and your endless refill mug closet to coffee pot One of only two places in town to get a beer at 7 am on a weekday and without a funny look The smoked salmon baguette lost the canned roasted red peppers but upgraded to actual chunks of freshly smoked fish instead of the boring old lox Look to the specials board for enlightenment and entertainment Ask your server if they like what you are thinking about ordering Ask all of the staff Go often get to know them (they are good people) get to know the food (hit or miss) find what you like and tip accordingly Here\&#39;s a tip: it\&#39;s meatless 25/5 Oh Blacksburg For such a quaint college town it is surprisingly void of quaint restaurants Gillies may be the one exception The food was yummy and inexpensive My only complaint: The staff acted as if they had been feasting on quaaludes--glazed eyes and murmured responses Literally next door to a vibrant college campus you would expect a pool of energetic employs to choose from however this place remains a blackhole of enthusiasm 4 starts for the food however Spanish Fritata rocks my world Oh my boyfriend loves the breakfast spicy burrito if only bacon was vegitarian Also I\&#39;m a big fan of the smoke-freeness of the place and enough hippies to make me feel like I\&#39;m back in Colorado Gillie\&#39;s is pretty cool A number of pescetarian vegetarian and vegan choices are offered in this funky little restaurant where dried beans and steamy fern terraria form part of the decor I tried my first helping of seitan here (the Moroccan seasoned entree) and found it to be a chewier heartier meat substitute than tofu Served with a cold local Virginia brew to cut the spiciness it was just right for a summer dinner Portion was a little small for this $12 meal but it filled me up Our server was friendly and recommended things for us to try and I could get behind the place\&#39;s politics (large posters on the wall advocating against the coming of a new Super Walmart) Don\&#39;t let the prices fool you the servings are huge Definitely some tasty breakfast items to be tried We tried the pancakes and the French toast and were very satisfied Don\&#39;t expect to find bacon or sausage here it\&#39;s a vegetarian restaurant - if you didn\&#39;t already know Split an order of the breakfast potatoes it\&#39;s big enough for two people For that matter if you get the pancakes just get two they are huge I went to Blacksburg to see a buddy of mine who lives there and he recommended we go to Gillie\&#39;s for brunch wellafter eating there I insisted on going back the next two mornings in a row! A great place for a veggie guy to have breakfast! I only wish we had a Gillie\&#39;s up in Northern VA!!! Miss you guy\&#39;s every morning!!! I\&#39;ll be back soon! This place is great especially for breakfast The crowds can be tough anytime (breakfast or when there is live music) Before moving to town everyone told me that I had to go Really the only pure vegetarian restaurant option in the Burg A vegetarian\&#39;s dream! There is a variety of unique entrees and appetizers to choose from and they also offer seafood as well The brunch here is legendary and all their food is made with the freshest ingredients so that you can taste the quality in every bite They also cook using olive oil so you can expect your meal to be healthy as well Good choice if you\&#39;re up for trying something new Best breakfast in Blacksburg  hands down I\&#39;m not a fan of the lunch and dinner simply because I still like a piece of meat with a meal but the breakfast is top-notch Haven\&#39;t had a thing I wouldn\&#39;t eat again including the pancakes and Chappie\&#39;s Choice (eggs with white cheddar and thick cut potatoes) The whole atmosphere is nice really - lots of ambient noise laughter and smells Great little spot downtown Great place for breakfast! I\&#39;m not a vegetarian but this offers a great alternative to the norm Plus the place is very quaint and the service was excellent NB: My ratings are scaled for Blacksburg Five stars here is equivalent to about three stars in the San Francisco Bay Area Ah a little slice of Berkeley in Blacksburg Gillie\&#39;s serves vegetarian (and some fish) breakfasts lunches and dinners It is probably the best restaurant in town in terms of creative and tasty dishes Breakfast is superb and I have gained a new appreciation for large fluffy buttermilk biscuits that I slather with quality jam sneaked (snuck?) in from home I almost always opt for Red Earth (~$5 in 2008): scrambled eggs intermixed with spicy red potatoes and topped with salsa The eggs are never dry or clumpy the potatoes are usually perfectly tender and crispy on the outside and the spicing can vary from medium to salty Other varieties such as Chappie\&#39;s Choice (cheese but no salsa) are similarly excellent The tofu scramble is another good breakfast option It\&#39;s an enormous pile of tofu baked in a barbecue-style sauce Lunches are also very good My standard is the tofu reuben although the specials are usually imaginative and tasty too For a southern-style breakfast Gillie\&#39;s even outperforms a spot that the New York Times raved about in Charleston SC great breakfast joint in blacksburg! if you want brunch on weekends prepare to wait! it\&#39;s always packed!i love their breakfast here! everything\&#39;s great! even the bread that comes with the meal is great!although you can get breakfast for a cheaper price on campus  it\&#39;s a great place to eat at and hang out on a sunny day! i used to always come to gillie\&#39;s and get a glass of fresh pear juice with a bit of lemon the juices are definitely the highlight of the menu the rest of which is hit or miss the specials tend to be more imaginative and fun but are also more pricey gillie\&#39;s is also one of the few places where i\&#39;ve eaten fake tuna done well (in a wrap as a lunch special) the restaurant gets super crowded for brunch on the weekends and can mean a fairly long wait for a table Loved it! After driving until midnight the night before and stopping over in Blacksburg we happened upon this great place on Sunday morning We were looking for a local breakfast/brunch place and found it The food and coffee were terrific (cooked by the owner\&#39;s sons) the staff friendly (LOVE HANNAH - she laughed at our terrible jokes!) and Mr Gillie (the owner) a doll We sat at the bar where we saw all the action and did not have to wait for a table A good option if there are only 2 or 3 of you We were exhausted when we arrived and left caffeinated filled with high quality yummy food and with big smiles on our faces When I visit my daughter at Tech it\&#39;s a sure bet we\&#39;ll be heading to the Cellar---she\&#39;s celiac and can indulge in Real Good Food That\&#39;s gluten free Looks like they have a terrific beer selection but I\&#39;m usually driving after so haven\&#39;t sampled thatsomeone needs to share :) I picked this place to eat because it was popular amongst locals and I was pretty disappointed The only reason it came up under the &#34;vegan&#34; tag was because one reviewer mentioned that they were vegan and found a way to substitute things so they could eat them not really expanding on what it was So I came here with the impression there would be something I could choose and eat easily Vegan options here are going to basically be just vegetables There are no labeled vegan options at all and I kind of just had to quickly pick something and run with it I choose the Greek Veggie Sub with no feta or Greek yogurt based sauce kind of wish I went with pizza instead although the pizza sizes seemed way small for the price? Especially since mine literally would\&#39;ve been just vegetables just like my sub was I was pretty disappointed with my sub to be fair I thought I had ordered a gyro/wrap and I hate white bread as it\&#39;s really just filler It sucks they charged full price even though I took out pretty much everything too lol Overall if you\&#39;re vegan skip this place and go to Gillie\&#39;s if you can I hate that I couldn\&#39;t order anything without asking a million questions or just guessing and hoping there wasn\&#39;t animal products in it The only thing that really saved this from being a bad review is the curly fries Those were really good and I recommend those a lot! The service was also really good although I wish I took a bit longer to ruminate over possible vegan options If you\&#39;re vegan and have to come here one way or another it is likely that removing the cheese on the vegetarian items will make it vegan Honestly there could\&#39;ve been egg or something in the bread I really hope the Cellar catches up with modern times and starts labeling/providing food for plant based eaters Pretty good place on the strip but be ready for a noisy mealI don\&#39;t know if it\&#39;s always like this but it was loud as all get out when we were there on a Thursday night It was really hard to hear each other for most of the visit Definitely a happening little place in a college townI like that they had bottled Stewart\&#39;s sodas available in addition to their fountain drinks We ordered some of the loaded curly fries and that was a good choice The habanero chili is great stuff The loaded fries aren\&#39;t the same as those listed on menus you\&#39;ll find on-lineThe meatball sub had a serious amount of meatballs with it and the sauce worked itSadly the feta calzone with chicken and artichokes didn\&#39;t work out for us The dough was almost sweet which just didn\&#39;t go along with the artichokes and kind of was weird with the salty feta tooOverall a good eat Just not the atmosphere for everyone and some menu items don\&#39;t win Looking for dinner we chose this place on a sleepy Monday night because it seemed casual but had an interesting Greek-themed menu The atmosphere was unremarkable but the patio seating was nice The service was admittedly a bit slow - we ended up getting our appetizer with our main meal instead of before itBeyond that though the food was good We had the tzatziki dip for an appetizer and liked it very much For dinner we ordered two pizzas: the special of the day (a sort of caprese pizza) and a Greek Gyro pizza The latter was the better of the two; the meat was good and the toppings just right The former was good but it was a bit drowned in olive oilOverall not bad but a few improvements could make this a better place to eat Favorite place to go to when I\&#39;m back visiting Blacksburg! I wish I appreciated it more as an undergraduate and it didn\&#39;t take me so long to realize how amazing it was They have outdoor seating indoor seating and basement seating! The basement has the main bar area which by the way has the best Irish car bombs and the only ones I\&#39;ll drink in Blacksburg They always have the &#34;luck of the draw&#34; beer special Basically instead of picking a beer you tell the waitress you\&#39;re going to do luck of the draw and she\&#39;ll randomly select one for you for the price of $2The cellar has the BEST spinach and artichoke dip that is served with warm pieces of pita bread Honestly I can not rave about it enough because I always get it The pizzas are really good too but nothing tops the spinach and artichoke dip I have also tried the mushroom ravioli which I really like! They serve it with some garlic bread which tastes amazing dipped in the marinara sauce Great food and very lively atmosphere! I think I\&#39;ve officially been to the Cellar more as a graduate then when I was a student at Tech (for eating) It\&#39;s become one of my favorite places to eat or chill drink in Blacksburg when I go back for basketball or football games I\&#39;ve NEVER had a bad meal there and the drink selection has and always will be a strength of the Cellar I recently for the first time had their Cajun Shrimp Dip with the pita It was INCREDIBLE I have no idea how I have never tried it and it makes me sad thinking about how I missed out for so long but also happy because I know what\&#39;s in my future Of course the pizzas are pretty good and the pastas I\&#39;ve had have never disappointed Just an all around great place to go The seating could be a little better upstairs and downstairs - tough to stand at the entrance and hover near a table to make sure you get one but it\&#39;s worth itSo whether you\&#39;re there sifting through a bunch of beers before going out or grabbing a drink while waiting for a table at Sharkey\&#39;s The Cellar has you covered Solid 3 1/2 -- cute little pub/bar just across the street from VTech\&#39;s campus We stopped in for lunch and ate out on the patio since the weather was nice I ordered the french dip which came with chips The sandwich and au jus were pretty good The chips were hella stale We also ordered these fried avocado bite appetizers that were pretty tasty Service was sort of slow especially given that it wasn\&#39;t particularly busy when we visited For two sandwiches the apps and a couple drinks our lunch was over $40 -- so for the quality vs price it was a little on the steep side I\&#39;d probably stop here again if I\&#39;m in town and the occasion presented itself They were ridiculously busy They have outdoor seating and indoor seating The surprise to me is that they offer basement seating You would never know unless a waitress tells you Very casual dining I mean you have to find a table on your own to fit your party Tonight their menu was very limited because they were running out of food I mean they even ran out of straws for drinks At least our waitress found me some short drink straws The service was fantastic It was so busy but our waitress didn\&#39;t miss a beat She cleaned our table for us and brought us our menu\&#39;s asap She took our drink orders came back with our drinks and took our order Everything came out pretty fastWe ordered their grilled chicken skewers steamed broccoli with roasted potatoes Chicken salad lemon orzo soup gyro sandwich plus a personal pizza and everything was delicious It was really a fun and loud crowd Definitely glad we found this place The Cellar is an intimate bar and a great place to meet up with old friends in Blacksburg My favorite dishes are the steak alfredo and the spinach artichoke dip Bar service is fast and recommendedDinner service is often slow so plan for extra timePitchers of beer are between 8 and 15 Awesome reco from a local Started with great service from Kelsey Told her we had cycled all day and she got us water immediately and kept the glasses full all mealI mentioned I saw a plate of spaghetti and meatballs coming out and could not believe the size of it and in particular the meatballs She said their meatballs were very popular and a meatball was available as an appetizer I ordered one with extra sauce and it was absolutely crazy good! Hardly any filler - just well seasoned meat and a killer sauce Everyone who shared it loved it especially with their garlic breadKelsey knew the beer and food menu inside and out and had great suggestions We had been told they had great pizza/calzones and Greek salads My wife wanted a calzone - it was huge and had a great crispy crust and lots of cheese and fillings We took half of it home I and 3 others had the Greek salad and everyone enjoyed it The dude who operates/owns/takes charge of the brew cellar next door is so gosh darn knowledgeable I want to sit next to him and listen to him spout off tips and insight all danged day- and I don\&#39;t even drink! So for this dark haired gem of a man and the selection of brews never before seen or available anywhere else in the region:5 stars all day longFood on offer: 3Who cares about the food though if you are well &#34;lubricated&#34; anyway? I\&#39;ve been coming to The Cellar for years They have a massive beer selection and great food On top of that the beer is super cheap I\&#39;ve definitely paid double for some of the beers I see in other cities I have so many great memories of this place where my friend and I would come after working at Macado\&#39;s and then speed over to hit them up before they close for a meal and some drinks This most recent time I got the black and bleu salad It was massive and even came with garlic bread! It had the works on it as well with peppers mushrooms and all other veggies It wasn\&#39;t the best quality but the variety kept it interesting They get a knock for slow dinner service Don\&#39;t come here in a rush Great little place with outdoor seating Great friendly staff Drinks and food were awesome! Had salad calzone and pasta Aegean  left full and happy! One of my all time favorite places to eat in Blacksburg I always try to pay them a visit whenever I come to Blacksburg My two favorite things to order: Bacon &amp; cheese fries and chicken kabobs but you can\&#39;t really go wrong with anything on their menu The order of cheese fries is enough to get you full as an appetizer you\&#39;ll definitely want to share with at least 1-2 other people It\&#39;s probably not the best place if you\&#39;re on a diet but it\&#39;s worth the cheat day ;) Every once in a while (maybe 1 in 4 times) I have the BEST PIZZA I\&#39;VE EVER HAD here A pita pizza With artichoke hearts feta and garlicI\&#39;m so eager for the next BEST PIZZA I\&#39;VE EVER HAD that I pretty much stick to that orderIt\&#39;s really the only remaining Blacksburg classic (at least from my days) This is a staple date night restaurant for me and my boyfriend! We prefer the downstairs seating bc the ambiance is nice down there The food is always solid and the curly fries and cheesy garlic bread is a go to every time we go! My favorite dishes to get are the gyros and chicken souvlaki and my bf loves the vegetarian tortellini! The drinks are solid the staff is nice and the food is tasty! Great place to hang with friends or have a little date night! Good appetizers and pizza The beer was diverse and good Service is slow but friendly This is my &#34;go to&#34; Blacksburg It\&#39;s reliable; I find the wait staff invariably helpful; and the food is consistently quite good or better The variety of food on the menu makes it an easy choice with a diverse group of people I typically get this soup and grilled cheese option if it\&#39;s the special and I\&#39;m always very happy This is a classic Blacksburg go-to and a nostalgic restaurant for my family and I! I love how they have added/expanded the outdoor patio area because Blacksburg often has perfect weather in the spring for eating outsideI often get the spaghetti and meatballs or a pepperoni pizza (I\&#39;ll admit I order pretty plain stuff but the Cellar always cooks it to perfection) Their meatballs are always delicious!If you are looking to get drinks or finger-food head to the bar downstairs! They have plenty of great beers (both bottled and on tap) and great house drinksAlso be sure to go to the beer store attached next door for a great selection of local and craft beers (one of the best selections in Blacksburg along with Vintage Cellar) A quality B-burg restaurant The fried avocado and pizzas are really good! I want to go back and try more items on the menu! This is a Blacksburg staple I enjoy the kinda worn/vintage atmosphere downstairs in the bar area The food is very reasonably priced THEY HAVE GLUTEN FREE PIZZA AND BREAD!!! If you haven\&#39;t gone please do If you like beer and American food you won\&#39;t be disappointed Don\&#39;t graduate without checking this place out Best food and drinks in Blacksburg and hands-down the best bartender She\&#39;s been there a long time and is amazing Do not miss out on a pita pizza from The Cellar when you are in Blacksburg And duh always go downstairs not upstairs One of my favorite places in Blacksburg the Cellar is a cozy establishment and a great place to grab dinner and drinks downtown The Cellar is very lowkey and casual with an extensive menu offering Greek-American food options They have a pretty decent selection of gluten-free options and they can substitute any of their subs with their delicious gluten-free bread The spinach and artichoke dip is the best I have ever had!If you\&#39;re visiting while Virginia Tech is in session beware long waits and limited seating There isn\&#39;t a hostess so all the seating is first come first serve Really Good Pizza loved the white sauce pizza with Pineapple and Ham Best crust really decent on the toppings Love hanging out on the patio on Friday afternoon before the Friday Night Out concerts Great food and beer selection at good prices I stop into the Cellar about once or twice a year (at most) while visiting family Never been a regular but I\&#39;ve never once given someone disrespect or caused trouble here I always tip at least a dollar per drink And a couple of times I\&#39;ve had friends with me from out of town and brought them here since I\&#39;ve had decent experiences here But in the past year or so whenever this one particular bartender is working he\&#39;s given me this &#34;Oh what do you want?&#34; vibe I just shrugged it off previously thinking maybe this guy is getting low on his Geritol as you many of you with parents approaching elderhood are awareSo tonight I walk in- the first time since last fall- and this guy Bert this dusty aging wanna-be- hippy behind the bar demands to see my ID which I have no problem with Except he gives me this crazy amount of &#34;You\&#39;re not welcome here ****face&#34; kind of vibe Which confirmed that this is indeed a pattern with him I show it to him and he scans it intently as if I\&#39;m trying to rip this asshole off I in an attempt to make small talk joke about how bad my picture is With all the personality and arrogance of Melania Trump Burt slides it back to me like I was trying to give him a fake or something and asks reluctantly &#34;What would you like?&#34;I\&#39;m thinking &#34;I\&#39;d like to see you pull a couple shifts at iHop so you can see how people in the service industry are supposed to interact with paying tipping customers&#34; He loathsomely reaches into the fridge after I dunno deciding to honor this lowly patron Caesar would suffer me it appearedAt this point I\&#39;m just trying to figure out why this dude is exuding tude like Ravishing Rick Rude ya heard? I mean you\&#39;d have thought I traipsed into the place and said &#34;I\&#39;ll take a glass of water with a freshly cut lemon; I hate when the lemons just sit there on the bar so I just wanna see you slice it in front of me please Also I\&#39;ve got this coupon from 2010- I don\&#39;t see an expiration date on it And also you better get your cleaning supplies ready cuz I got crazy diarrhea that sprays outta me like a bottle of Windex all over the wall behind me Oh and don\&#39;t worry I know you guys close in 5 minutes so I\&#39;ll be gone by then&#34;I can come up with no reason other than the fact that I ordered a PBR which Berty felt was somehow contemptible I mean look Bert I don\&#39;t judge your decision to obviously skip flossing those corn kernels you call &#34;teeth&#34; on a regular basis friend so I\&#39;m not sure why ordering a cheap beer is worthy of treating me like some kind of dog euthanizer Didn\&#39;t realize ordering a PBR would incur such attitude from the president of the local AARP chapter moonlighting as a bartender You\&#39;d think asking for a PBR would be an alley-oop for one who tends bar in return for monetary compensation aka &#34;a professional&#34; Can\&#39;t wait for the day that Victoria\&#39;s Secret buys this plot of land slams a three-story on top of this place pushing waves of dust out in every direction and our boy has to try and pull this crap where they won\&#39;t just let it slide like the Cellar Restaurant &amp; 6-Pack Store does When Crate And Barrel becomes your new employer they\&#39;re not going to allow you to bend the bill of your baseball cap in half like that and roll in like you\&#39;re putting in your community service hours with the Blacksburg Little LeagueAt this point it doesn\&#39;t matter since I\&#39;m never stepping into this place again as I have no reason I overlooked his piss-poor attitude more than once over a long stretch of time and this just seals it for me Not that it matters as Bert will likely continue smoking bowls and then coasting in here for his shift with his eyebrows raised inferring insightfulness like he\&#39;s somehow above the din envisioning himself as some chill mellow guy with excellent taste in music without even realizing that he\&#39;s just another jam-band douchebag walking around cracking wiseTLDR Many decades ago a man lost his squirt and called it &#34;Bert&#34; Always like a little slice of heaven here in Blacksburg Grew up here and me and my family always come back and order the same thing! The Greek spaghetti is absolutely BOMB! Not a fan of beers but my family says the brews/brew selection is great Can get crowded if you\&#39;re a townie so we always go during the summer or the holidays when the students aren\&#39;t around Overall amazing place and wait staff is always full of knowledge I\&#39;ve been here twice - once for dinner inside and once for appetizers and drinks outside Both times the service was great and the food was great The only complaints I have are that with the dips they don\&#39;t provide nearly enough chips/pita and that the seating system outside is extremely unorganized When it\&#39;s warm out and everyone wants to sit outside you can\&#39;t have people just hovering around others that are eating waiting to pounce on their table once they get up we saw it a lot while we were sitting in addition to having to do that to get ourselves a table It\&#39;s awkward standing in the area in the middle of everything waiting but if you walk away someone will take the table you\&#39;ve been waiting for Needs a better system Ate here late on a Tuesday and we were only people in the restaurant Food and service was great Would come back if ever again in area for bar food! Very tender philly cheese steak! Quick service! Our order was up in no time! Very friendly wait staff nice atmosphere! We were shocked at just how much food we got for so little money! Cheap beer and good food I had the calzone and it was delicious This a step above college dive bar but you have to review it for what it is What it is trying to do it does very well Highly recommended even for parents coming in town I love the pita pizza lunch special I have gotten it more times than I can count They also have great pasta dishes The service isn\&#39;t particularly fast but that\&#39;s alright because this is a fun place to just hangout Love the beer selection! This was one of my favorite restaurants when I was in college It has reasonably priced large meals that can likely be saved to make two meals The alcohol is decently priced and it\&#39;s quiet enough that you can hear people while dining Solid choice Huge portions You can split a half sandwich easily Drink specials are nice One of the few places in Blacksburg with real ambience Hammer time on Sundays! This was the first restaurant I\&#39;ve ever eaten while in Blacksburg and it will always be one of my favorites I love their curly fries - I\&#39;m a fanatic for fries And my favorite dish has to be the big daddy meatballs So delicious and I recommend everyone to try!!! Whatever you end up getting whether it\&#39;s pasta or pizza you will not be upset Such a great spot in this college town Met up with my husband\&#39;s old roommate from their time at Tech and enjoyed a nice meal and beers together as we chatted Mike had been here years ago by since then they did remodel the inside Defend the stairs and your taken into a cellar turned into a bar/restaurant The menu has options for everyone\&#39;s palate and the beer options are plenty I chose the Greek Spaghetti and a Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale The Greek Spaghetti really was a huge portion! I made about 3-4 meals out of it I added grilled chicken to my dish for protein Inside this dish is olives feta Greek spices of oregano red peppers onionsgreen peppers and a few others that I can\&#39;t recall but this really was an addictive dish! I couldn\&#39;t stop myself but knew I had too as I had that bourbon Ale to enjoy along with my meal The bartender was not only serving people sitting at the bar but also the tables around it She was on a roll watching her zip through the people serving up ice cold beer and piping hot food The atmosphere is casual and the lighting is dim Deafly looking forward to coming back here and trying one of the cellar baked pizzas and maybe a calzone too! Some of the dishes are also offered up as gluten-free you\&#39;ll see it on the menu next to those items I seriously love this place best artichoke dip I\&#39;ve had! I love going in even if i\&#39;m there with 5 people and it\&#39;s packed it feels intimate and the place has a great vibe overall Would definitely recommend to anyone! It shows the restaurant close at 2 AM Last night I called in at 1 to order a spaghetti to go The lady answered the phone and told me they are about to close and cannot make my spaghetti! I can\&#39;t believe it takes that much time to make a spaghetti probably Horrible late night experience I love the cellar Dope drink menu HOWEVER there are VERY skimpy vegetarian options I would like more (healthy ish) vegetarian options here If they had like veggie sliders or cauliflower buffalo wings TAKE MY MONEY WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER Where to begin? I have no fucking clue First offOur waitress greeted us and said she would be back with our waters and appetizer shortly Well that was a damn lie We asked multiple employees because their spinach dip and pita was so god damn salty (honestly pretty good tho) I damn near choked on that dry ass pita But god forbid i needed the heimlich I\&#39;m sure the sun would set before I got a fucking glass of water Now to the entree situation Or should I say disaster We ordered and specifically pointed at the chicken souvlaki kabobs on literally the front page We got our food and pop goes the fucking weasel it is nothing like what we ordered And I knew this because I got the Kabobs before This girl does not even apologize or ask what we want to do she instead argues insists that WE were wrong and we were at fault for &#34;ordering the wrong thing&#34; Instead she plops one plate of potatoes and dry ass asparagus if only they could put some of the jenkie salt on the asparagus maybe it would have been edible How is this plate of potatoes supposed to make up for our order being completely BOTCHED She scurries away immediately without asking if what we had was okay and we decided we just wanted the right thing we originally ordered After 20 minutes of waiting for to come to our table we asked politely if we could have what we ordered She said ok without an apology for all of the confusion but clearly could not give a rats ass about our table Might I add in the meantime my water is EMPTY I was eating the fucking ice I was so thirsty and god forbid we ask for a water Game over Sooo another half hour goes by were not even hungry because we are so furious at the situation But we got our food It wasn\&#39;t even good When she finally returns for the table we ask for the check and boxes to see that we were charged for the full price no compensation at all for the inconvenience we experienced Also in this time that we were waiting for our food we saw multiple groups of customers being seated at dirty tables with dirty plates No one was being taken care of BOTTOM LINE Food is fine Service is fucked Don\&#39;t waste a minute of your time in this absurd god awful restaurant And I\&#39;d just like to add I am not a psychopath I am a patient and forgiving human being Who also happens to be a waitress so I understand the stress and that mistakes happen but no server in that place could give a single FUCK about what happened to you while you were there I could have been eating off the floor and nobody would have batted an EYE That is all Thanks for fucking my day and my stomach up the Cellar The food was good I got a meat lovers calzone and the portion was big and it was filled to the max with different meats and cheeses My family got the prime rib french dip the habanero chili and baked ziti They weren\&#39;t the best dishes we have ever had but they were still pretty good The service however was extremely slow Our waiter was not very welcoming and some other people that came after us got their food before us I would\&#39;ve given it 5 stars if the service was faster and if our waiter was more accommodating Everything here was so good and hot! It was busy surprisingly when we came in early on a Saturday night and we still got good service They do need to put a sign on the door letting people know it is seat yourself however me and three other groups had to ask Food portions are big for some great leftovers and there is even a cool bar downstairs too The Cellar is always a VT/Blacksburg favorite for all students and locals That means that you can probably expect The Cellar to be packed on the weekends/major events If you plan to come here plan accordingly so you don\&#39;t have to wait!I\&#39;ve been here plenty of times and each time I always find myself feeling &#34;squeezed&#34; The restaurant itself really small and their isn\&#39;t much personal space That doesn\&#39;t really effect the food quality but it\&#39;s something worth noting if you\&#39;re claustrophobic The restaurant is self-seated so if it\&#39;s really packed then you\&#39;re probably gonna have to stand somewhere and until a table opens upLet\&#39;s talk about FOOD Order the curly fries to start out! They\&#39;re always a safe bet and they\&#39;re really easy to share with a group From the multiple times I\&#39;ve been here I would recommend getting the Pasta Aegean or the Prime Rib French Dip TIP: If you go during their lunch special they give you a 6 inch sub with a soup of choice for a reasonable price which is a pretty good deal in my opinion The portions are generous and the food quality is pretty good The service is a little slow in my opinion but other than that it\&#39;s a safe place to go if you find yourself in the downtown area of Blacksburg! This was a great pitstop on our road trip We decided to sit outside and I ordered the Greek gyro I was able to substitute potato salad instead of chips for no additional charge which was a nice bonus The gyro came on really soft and delicious pita bread and the portion size was very generous My boyfriend got the chicken kabob platter He really appreciated the abundance of gluten free options and the clear GF labeling on the menu We don\&#39;t have any plans to return to Blacksburg but I would recommend this place to anyone I knew who was headed there! The service was good the beer was cold and apparently most of the food is good Crab ravioli Alfredo though was a crime against crabs The Alfredo sauce was good but that filling was like eating sour salty sawdust I don\&#39;t think it was real crab Stopped here for dinner The outdoor area was really nice but it was packed so my husband and I went downstairs to eat We were a little caught off-guard to see how dark it was Definitely a hipster pub feel which was fine by us we were just expecting it to be a little nicer We sat at the bar which was only serving a few people We were kind of annoyed that we weren\&#39;t greeted right away as there were about 3 or 4 girls behind the bar not doing much but talking amongst themselves and we saw other guests greeted much quicker than us Finally we were greeted after about 5 or more minutes I ordered the Greek gyro and my husband ordered the chili as an app and souvlaki chicken in a pita The chili was good- not really spicy and it was on the sweeter side The Greek gyro was just okay- the meat could have been cooked up a bit longer so it has a crispy texture on the edges like authentic gyro meat The tzatziki sauce was delicious! My husband loved his meal Overall we\&#39;d probably go back again if in the area but the service was mediocre They could step up their &#34;friendly game&#34; a bit Went here for the first time last night and I am glad I did Good selection of international and domestic beer There was a ribeye on the specials menu and I am always a little cautious when ordering steak because you never know the quality of the meat whether it has been frozen or if the cook knows how to prepare it properly Our waitress was very nice and I asked her if customers were generally happy with the steak and she didn\&#39;t flinch and answered a very convincing YES It was a GREAT steak Juicy soft delicious and perfectly cooked to medium rare as ordered My son ordered a pizza and was very happy with it The prices were reasonable also My only complaint about the restaurant is that it has seat yourself inside and outside tables which was a bit confusing being my first time there and not knowing It was busy and I couldn\&#39;t find a hostess so we were standing in the middle of the dining room while waitresses carrying food whizzed by Now I know Lively atmosphere quick service and great place for birthday dinners Every time I\&#39;ve come here it\&#39;s been for a friend\&#39;s birthday and every time I\&#39;ve come it\&#39;s been packed Definitely a hot spot in downtown Blacksburg Parking is great too Comprable to other restaurants in the area but hands down a Blacksburg classic--nice and close to campus This Italian Greco restaurant is a Blacksburg staple It has a family-friendly upstairs floor (which was packed on a Saturday night) and a basement bar which feels like a typical college dive bar The drink menu is extensive but I didn\&#39;t come here for drinks my brothers and I came for the pizza and subs - boy did they deliver We split a 16&#34; house special pizza which Yelp gave $3 off for checking in and it hit the spot The dough was chewy the cheese was melty hot and the toppings were fresh In addition to the pizza we ordered mushroom ravioli veggie sub and a bacon burger and shared family style Each dish came with delicious hot curly fries and the portions were very generous For vegetarians I highly recommend the veggie sub with tender well-cooked veggies topped with tangy tzatziki sauce If you\&#39;re looking for solid hardy eats in downtown Blacksburg I highly recommend the Cellar The Calzones are top notch Very laid back environment and quality food for a great price! My family and I decided to go here for dinner after visiting Virginia Tech It was packed We got a couple appetizers that were good but their taziki sauce was one of the best ever and the spicy cajun shrimp dip came with the right amount of pita slices Enough that you didn\&#39;t run out before finishing the dip The gyro was very good as was the souvlaki French dip was ok and the Margareta pizza was pretty good too We saw others getting calzones which looked really good  During dinner the fire alarm went off and startled everyone After a minute or two it stopped but no-one really told us why it went off A local policeman came to check it out as well as the fire department but there was no fire Overall not a bad place to eat Not much of a wait seated in the Cellar close to the back wall Food was good server was really slow We watched another waitress handle several large groups (8+ people) smoothly and fast! No worries as the beer was cold and refreshing after an extremely hot football game Our table ordered subs and I had the grilled chicken Greek salad all very tasty! Thanks First thing you notice with the cellar is its fairly quaint decor It\&#39;s a sit yourself type of deal and luckily we were able to find seats relatively easy It took a little while before me and my girlfriend were served and throughout the whole night our waiter was very nonverbal which was a bit offputting The menu was also a little priceyHOWEVER the food was actually quite tasty being my first time at this restaurant We didn\&#39;t wait more than 10 minutes and both our appetizers and entrees already came out The serving sizes are huge for what you pay for! The Cajun shrimp dip appetizer was extremely satisfying and the French dip sandwich and pasta Aegean we got were also delicious A few complaints I do have include the sandwich being a little lacking in meat and the pasta tasting a little bland Overall the cellar is a good restaurant to hang out and have some quality food but service could be a little better Good choice if you\&#39;re in the mood for pizza or pasta although menu has a good variety of choices Pizza crust perfect not too doughy or too crispy Good service! Patio seating available Excellent food in a college town We moved my sister in on a Thursday and came for dinner Since everyone was just getting back to town the place was busy but not overwhelmingly so Great patio option for people watching downtown  My chicken kebab pita sandwich was very very good The potato salad was also good and the portions were just right My mom dad and sister all enjoyed their meals as well Not a single complaint from this picky group We all agreed that we would not hesitate to return One of my very favorite dinner spots in Blacksburg Seating is occasionally an issue but the food is always delicious so I don\&#39;t mind The food and service are impeccable! Great gyros and kabobs I choose the ribeye which is a very common special and incredible for the price Server was polite and down to earth They keep hard to find beer on tap and in the well stocked beer store I noticed the staff were happy to be there (hard to find in the service industry) I see why The Cellar is a cornerstone for dining in Blacksburg  Keep it up chief! There is nothing &#34;Greek Tradition&#34; about frozen food from a bag and maranara sauce from a can A tad bland - ordered here multiple times The spaghetti/Greek pastas are okay decent tons of noodles for one order However it was too salty the first time I had it so I asked for less salt No salt at all in the next order It\&#39;s probably the best Italian restaurant in this area but I definitely had disappointment when I saw really good reviews overall hereOther stuff they have are 4-5 stars worthy though! Definitely would come again for other orders than the pastas/spaghetti Always a stop while I am in town Love the luck of the draw beers and the food is always great We were visiting Blacksburg for a conference and this restaurant was a good find The place is lively and friendly for group dinners We ordered different Greek food and everybody was happy with their section I had ordered Blackened Fresh Salmon with salad on side The salmon was well cooked and delicious They have good beer selection and not so good option for wines So it\&#39;s a great place for all beer lovers Overall it\&#39;s a great place to hang out and enjoy with friends Cute little place to eat right off of VT campus We had a party of 3 and it is a seat yourself restaurant so we did have to wait standing by the door for about 20 minutes until someone left Curly fries appetizer was gone in seconds and the personal pizzas were awesome as you can &#34;design&#34; your own (which is good because I\&#39;m a picky eater) Cool little spot Mixture of Greek and pizza They have an old-school pinball machine and it\&#39;s connected to a gourmet beer grocery shop Good food all around Good service all around Even had a cool little side room that can seat six people with a TV in itAttended with my family of 6 during Christmas break This place is awesome! Atmosphere is great! It\&#39;s pretty quiet and there is plenty of seating It\&#39;s an awesome change of pace from the other bars in Blacksburg because you can actually talk to one another Also hammer time is an awesome way to try a bunch of different beers without killing your wallet The food is amazing as well I think this might be the lone holdout of restaurants from back when I lived here 20 years ago Back then it was one of the &#34;fancier&#34; places to eat in town and not one that a collage student could afford very often It was wonderful to go here last night with the family and see that so little had changed They of course now have gluten free pizza crusts but their regular pizza crust seems just the same as it was 20 years ago - soft and chewy but light at the same time We had a starter of mussels that I was initially skeptical of my husband ordering but how wrong I was they were fantastic! The broth was so good we had to get a second load of bread for it and still dipped our pizza crust in it! We also had the kids spaghetti and marinara gyro pizza the meat lasagna baklava Tiromisu and the brownie Everything was very good I also have to point out that usually long lasting restaurants end up getting dingy with dust in all the crevasses but they are doing a stand up job keeping this place quite clean I also love the beer wine store next door Finally there is nothing that says you are in a collage town than pitchers of beers and a shooter list! We came to The Cellar on a Saturday night with friends for dinner/drinks We found a table downstairs right by the bar This place is definitely a fun/chill vibe The crowd is older than you\&#39;d expect in a college town but our local friends told us it\&#39;s the grad student bar makes sense Our waitress was a nice girl but so very spacey haha she forgot one of our meals altogether lol We had beers (beers are like $4 awesome) and got some appetizers: loaded fries (the best one!) artichoke spinach dip and garlic bread (the garlic bread wasn\&#39;t too good skip it) For our entrees I got the gyro which was actually delish! My hubs had a cheese steak which he really liked and others had pizza some other sandwiches etc Great spot for a fun dinner and drinks with friends! Cellar of cellar is great for Friday nights Cool place with good crowd Comparatively crowded than other bars in the town But a must visit in Blacksburg if u are with bunch of friends OMG the Greek gyro with tzatziki sauce is absolutely wonderful; the best I\&#39;ve had (and I\&#39;ve had them in many places) Everything else being served looked great and the place was jumping for lunch Friendly staff and fast service makes this a place to definitely revisit! I have been going to this place for years and the food just keeps getting better! Fantastic college town restaurant atmosphere This is a really fun spot and my calzone was legitimately one of the better calzones I\&#39;ve eaten Great cocktails too If I lived in Blacksburg this place would definitely be a regular stop! This was my second time coming here I wanted to order the crab ravioli but they didn\&#39;t have it so I ordered a crab cake sandwich which made me throw up later that night The buns of the sandwich were completely black from being burned Not sure why they thought it was okay to serve that to someone They also have bold rock which is a plus however it\&#39;s not on their menu which should be updated TLDR: don\&#39;t get the crab cake sandwich Considering this is listed as a Greek restaurant I expected them to have more Greek items on the menu Instead the menu is filled with Italian and American dishes This disappointed me since I was looking forward to having Greek food I ended up ordering a gyro sandwich which just turned out to be just okay The meat was too salty for my taste And I was very surprised at the lack of vegetables available When I ordered vegetables I was given a puzzled look and was offered a salad instead My guess is that menu alterations had to be made in order to cater to the college crowd But not sureThe service was good and very quick but I was not completely impressed Perhaps I\&#39;ll have to try something new next time I am in town The food wasn\&#39;t awful but I don\&#39;t think it\&#39;s worthy of a rating over 3 stars Pretty amazing downtown in the middle of virginia Unexpected and really good combinations of Greek and American fusion It got a little noisy at night with a Jazz Band The Cellar is my favorite restaurant in Blacksburg hands down I\&#39;ve been to the restaurant at least 30 times in the past two years and I\&#39;ve never been disappointed I love pizza and their Pita Pizzas are phenomenal; as well as their chilli (which are my two main dishes) Their seating outside provides a wonderful atmosphere during the warm months and their &#34;seat yourself&#34; philosophy is pretty refreshing and makes eating their very straight forward Great food and great beers!! I am fan of this place Their curly fries their shrimp dip (the spinach and artichoke dip is also good) their calzones and their entres are excellent!! The ambience is great as well They play good music sometimes there is live music The service is good all the timeIn case you are into beers this place has an amazing collection! I ordered a medium veggie pizza and it was delicious ! The ingredients were fresh and warm They arrived late on delivery though This pizza reminded me of a better version of Pizza Hut! We had mixed feelings about coming here at first The few locals we asked recommended it mentioning is was some of the better food downtown However the reviews on YELP mostly referenced poor service and long wait times to even speak to a waitress We arrived on a fairly busy weeknight evening (about 9pm) and having left Hokie House because the service was terrible Fortunately within minutes our server greeted us Jessie (as the bill stated) couldn\&#39;t have been better In fact we thanked her for proving the doubters wrong She was pleasant came back often knew the menu in and out and beamed a wonderful vibe No complaints there This isn\&#39;t a high end spot by any means It\&#39;s a dark laid back atmosphere (downstairs) that\&#39;s seemingly overrun by students It isn\&#39;t wild and rowdy like many of the other places downtown fortunately The food isn\&#39;t great but beats many of the chains and greasy spots downtown And on a positive note they offer an extensive drink menuWe tried to sample a few things and started with the spinach salad which was impressive It wasn\&#39;t littered with iceberg lettuce rather fresh crisp greens and veggies that were impressive The dressing didn\&#39;t taste like it came out of a Costco bottle either As for the spaghetti and meatballs it was average at best Honestly it tasted like the sauce came out of a can and the meatballs were enormous but way overcooked We could have passed on this dish but as hungry as we were it was edible The pizza however did impress us and in this town has to be the best available I love this place I\&#39;ve been literally dozens of times But the owner has decided that straws are unnecessary and has discontinued them as an option Straws should be given as standard not a luxury This place has a LOT of gluten-free choices including gluten free beer If that\&#39;s what you need ( and if you don\&#39;t need) go here and enjoy Prost Great place Great food Their Stromboli and their Greek Spaghetti are two of my favorites Cozy friendly atmosphere Great atmosphere to watch the game Friendly and warm with good bar food Had a yummy gluten free grilled Brie sandwich with gluten free tomato soup Best Gluten-free beer selection at a restaurant I\&#39;ve ever seen and I live in Northern Virginia The gluten free pizza is delicious This is my favorite place to eat in Blacksburg when I visit Had a large pizza Was very good but large pizza only fed two people so kind of small portions Service was good and nice atmosphere Went there Saturday night after Radford graduation crazy I know Sat at the upstairs bar and was greeted by Jordan the friendly and attentive bartender I told Jordan that I was going to get the ribeye for dinner 14oz for $16 she suggested a great draft beer for the meal Firestone double barrel ale I ordered the steak rare and it was cooked to perfection Nice char on the outside and nice and juicy on the inside While waiting on my dinner I was watching the staff Amongst all the chaos of the evening the staff was unflappable Jordan was always checking in on me in the midst of making shots shooters crazy 21 year old kids drinks It\&#39;s been years since I\&#39;ve been to Va Tech but if I come back anywhere near here I\&#39;ll make the cellar my first and last stop I am a life ling NYer who knows and loved quality Pizzai have to say that the pizza i had here was outstanding Great Beer selection as well if youre into that My wife ordered a French Dip and while tasty there was barely any meat on itliterally a single slice of steakum style beef The Cellar really should be receiving higher reviews but the lack of service is enough to knock it down a star or two I enjoy the food and the atmosphere here however there\&#39;s been one too many times where I felt neglected by the waitresses I understand if you\&#39;re busy but ignoring your customers doesn\&#39;t help anything Not to mention they never apologize for taking too long or forgetting everything we requested Besides that I\&#39;d recommend any of the pita pizzas and the soup and salad combo is great! Great food Cool laid back bar scene My first restaurant in Blacksburg before my freshmen year at school and I\&#39;ll never forget it The pizza is to die for The basement is really cool and a great place to hang out on the late night Beer selection is great Love this place! I ate here in mid-June 2016 when I was in Blacksburg for a tripPros:-The mains were excellent - great crab cakes great kabobs-Friendly waitstaff-Good beer list-Live musicCons:-The veggie side was a bland &#34;passed once through steam&#34; broccoli straight out of the 1950s before Americans learned how to cook veggies with flavor - very disappointing-One of our biggest issues was that the tables in the center of the restaurant are too big for the restaurant If you are sitting at any of the center tables customers and waitstaff are non-stop banging the back of your chairs as they try to walk by Every dining party that initially sat at a center table eventually asked to move as soon as a side table became available which should be a clue to the management that something is wrong with their table layout Just felt way too cramped and uncomfortable-Our waitress went missing for long periods of time -We had a dirty plate given to us that we had to trade in for a clean oneYMMV:-It\&#39;s seat yourself which is always a little disorienting for first-timers and also annoying when it\&#39;s busy Just a head\&#39;s up about that better if you know going in-It\&#39;s VERY loud! Again not a problem for some but just so you know going inOverall it\&#39;s a toss-up whether I\&#39;d go again - if so not during dinner or lunch rush so I don\&#39;t get stuck in one of the center tables After Chief being changed it is not the same Cellar I ordered several dishes and pizza from cellar and unfortunately the taste is not good My favorite restaurant whenever I come into town Their calzones are legendary and the beer options and prices are great! Definitely the place to go if you\&#39;re visiting VA Tech! Prices are great and the food couldn\&#39;t be tastier My favorites? Spanakopita for an app souvlaki for the health conscious diner and the BBQ chicken calzone for the foodie! Our waitress was very attentive even though the place was packed house and Friday night so I give the service two thumbs up as well Definitely will come again whenever we\&#39;re in Blacksburg! Very good homemade food More gluten free choices than I\&#39;ve ever found in a restaurant $1 add on salad was full of veggies Chicken kebobs were juicy and sauce amazing Prime rib and mushroom sublime A Blacksburg tradition! Very casual atmosphere Wide ranging menu from pizzas subs calzones to gourmet entrees Great selection of beers on tap plus connected carry out store with huge selection of bottled beer Calzones are especially tasty Last time I had the special chicken ravioli with Alfredo sauce It was delicious and the fresh salad was also wonderful Solid choice in this college town I\&#39;m used to the best Greek and Italian food where I live normally This place didn\&#39;t disappoint on this trip Good beer selection food was flavorful Pizza was good though not like the Greek pizza we have in the northeast It was distinctly &#34;Greek&#34; however in that the crust was quite different from an Italian one Salad was beautifully presented and the Chicken Souvlaki was done right with excellent tatziki sauce If you don\&#39;t mind waiting and waiting and waiting The Cellar is pretty decent The service is incredibly slow and always has been There food isn\&#39;t bad but we haven\&#39;t been in a long time because we don\&#39;t often have two hours to spare for a meal Favorite restaurant in Blacksburg! Yum yum  A few years ago I went to The Cellar and the wait was so long and the staff was rude I vowed to never go back I must have been there on an off night because I realized I\&#39;ve been missing out big time by not going here It\&#39;s understandable that there will be a wait if you go on a weekend during rush hours because the place is so tiny inside but that adds to the charm If you\&#39;re waiting upstairs try out the basement there are a lot more seats and the menu is the same I actually prefer the basementI went last weekend with my parents and we all loved it I ordered a 6&#34; gyro and curly fries My mom tried to convince me to order an entree instead but I am so glad I didn\&#39;t listen First off the curly fries here are delicious They\&#39;re perfectly crunchy while not being over cooked with some great seasoning The gyro was so delicious maybe I love all gyros I eat though The gyro was pretty standard with lamb slices lettuce onions and tzatziki sauce The pita was perfectly moist sorry if you hate that word The only thing I wish was different was if there was a little extra tzatziki sauce on top but I probably always think that My mom got the chicken souvlaki kabobs The plate came with roasted potatoes asparagus and chicken kabobs(obviously) served with tzatziki The chicken kabobs were lightly marinated to perfection It was such a simple dish yet so delicious if you\&#39;re looking for a light option try this! My dad ordered the Aegean pasta dish Which was shrimp on top of linguine with feta cheese pesto tomatoes mushrooms garlic and some onions This dish was delicious as well and tasted pretty light and fresh for a pasta dish! My favorite dish here is the BBQ chicken pizza I think the crust is what makes it so good It\&#39;s so reasonable and delicious! I get it every time nowWish I was still in school so I could head to the Cellar right now Best pizza and calzone in blacksburg They also have a great bar downstairs with a great selection of drinks You\&#39;ve burned me one too many times Cellar I have been coming here for the last three and a half years and go to the bar downstairs regularly I worked in food service and am a forgiving person but after several instances of slow service and sullen waitresses/bar staff I\&#39;m through with you Friday nights with Tom downstairs is the ONLY time to go here All other times expect to wait for your food served by a delusional staff member that thinks you owe them for bringing out the food you are paying for Go to the Taphouse or Rivermill if you want a similar atmosphere Farewell Cellar you treat me unkind Always love going here for the luck-of-the-draw beer - pay $2 for a random beer selection The beer itself can be hit or miss but it\&#39;s always fun to go with a group and see what every gets The food is solid and atmosphere is laid back I would say that The Cellar is a pretty good representation of Blacksburg in general Students - this is a great place to bring your parents when they visit you at school! I was very happy with The Cellar Our original plan was Chipotle but the line was too long so we tried The Cellar and I\&#39;m glad we did! Great service good atmosphere and a good variety of options on the menu I got the chicken kabobs and it was excellent My girlfriend got the brie grilled cheese and chill and it was very good There was a huge selection of beer and a great drink menu also Great food selection and service Definitely worth a try! This place has both an upstairs and a small downstairsas the name states I have never been upstairs This place provides exactly what you\&#39;re looking for when searching for a drink in a college town My favorite bar/restaurant in town Especially love the bar downstairs! Love the decorgreat beer collection too! Enjoyed the shrimp dip Absolutely amazing food! I have never had a bad experience here All the wait staff are extremely nice and the food is always perfectly! My favorites are the pita pizza or the cheese steak sub! If you have never tried this place you should definitely go! Been going here for years Don\&#39;t go if you are in a hurry Otherwise good food at fair prices and interesting staff I mean interesting in a good way Love the Cellar! Big menu and most items are quality and delicious! Great beer selection Upstairs is great for dining and live music nightly downstairs is just right for heavy drinking My band plays there first Tuesdays yay! Love the atmosphere food is acceptable service is almost always SLOWThe vibe is always chill and positive Beer selection is solid Food is so-soIf you want to hang out take your time and have a relaxing evening The Cellar usually delivers If you are in a hurry or bring kids under 5 forget about itMy wife and I will be back but we will not be bringing our little ones with us for many years to come We ate dinner here after football game Place was busy and food came out a little slow  We had the shrimp appetizer  It was average but good cocktail sauce I had the grilled salmon salad which was surprisingly very good  Very filling  It was on the specials menu so I\&#39;m not sure if they have this all the time The salmon did not have that &#34;fishy&#34; taste that you find in other restaurants My husband had the the roast beef dip which he said was good  The curly fries weren\&#39;t very hot as his only complaint They have a range of beers The pizzas appeared to be good  The smell certainly was Atmosphere is casual Service was attentive I ate the Chicken Kabob there - not impressed It wasn\&#39;t bad but it wasn\&#39;t that good either Service was very good Went here during a weekend in July during when it was busy Ended up sitting at a table outside for 15 minutes with waitresses constantly going in and out and walking past our table before any of them finally got to us and offered us water We had to wait 10 minutes for our water and then after 20 minutes of waiting to just order our food I got too impatient and left with my boyfriend After the 15th time of trying to get a waitress\&#39;s attention and having them ignore us and pass through I gave up and left and maybe the food is phenomenal but I would not wait 45 minutes just to order it I tried the Greek spaghetti with veggies last time I went here and it was delicious! I just love everything I try at the Cellar and am never disappointed Easily one of my favorite establishments God damn it I love this place At the Cellar I\&#39;ve met and broken up with past and future loves who are now probably other peoples\&#39; wives In the dark depths of the Cellar I\&#39;ve learned about sports books cars television radio film art tattooing and animal husbandry I\&#39;ve drank from shot glasses pint jars sipped vodka through straws and hustled pickle juice into my gullet to soothe the recently arrived Jim Beam I\&#39;ve hugged strangers punched friends shaken hands with Julia and kissed Thom Go Drink Be Merry The pizza was great! The crust was delicious The service was super friendly We will be back! After 3+ years in Blacksburg this is my favorite hangout spot The pita pizzas are amazing you will not be disappointed I would recommend getting pesto mushrooms and pepperoni on your pizza I know the pesto sounds weird but it is amazing there I can also recommend the chicken souvlaki pita the Hummus appetizer (Its huge plenty to go around for the table) the cajun shrimp appetizer (however you have to peel all the shrimp yourself and you will get messy)all are very good I honestly have not had a bad meal thereIf you are just going there to drink and celebratemake sure not to miss Hammer time!Be prepared that service can be a bit slow Especially if you all order pita pizzas because they have to make them all and that takes some time This is my go-to bar in the area It\&#39;s a tad less undergraddy than Sharkey\&#39;s or Tots (If you\&#39;re looking for a townie bar try London Underground instead) The majority of the waitstaff are very kind and attentive (in two years only two less-than-ideal experiences and my friends and I go here frequently) The pita pizza is vey good and very cheap and their &#34;luck of the draw&#34; beer option is a great way to try new beers for only $2 a piece Otherwise there are many drink and food options all of which are good When people come to visit Blacksburg this is one of the places I take them (the other being Carol Lee Donuts) Decent food at a decent price but terrible service especially if you happen to sit outside 2/3 times I\&#39;ve been here I ended up waiting too long for food or even someone coming to take my order Walked in on a hunch One part is a small grocery store with speciality wine and what not The restaurant is connected There was a little confusion regarding the pick a seat and somebody will serve you eventually mentality However the sweet tea was delicious My gyro came out quickly and it was stuffed with lamb The sauce was perfect and the curly fries were hot and fresh Portion size was perfect My waitress was very attentive with a ready smile The crowd is a bit older which is nice for someone who has little patience for the raucous and often annoying college crowds that are expectantly everywhere in a college town I will definitely return This is an excellent place to eat I love it! The service is always extremely courteous and the food is always delicious! I had the best time down in the basement of The Cellar with my girl friends The prices were good and the food was just as good For that I give it two thumbs up I got the crab stuffed ravioli I was impressed because there was a very good amount of crab and other spices in the dish! Usually when you get seafood from a restaurant that doesn\&#39;t specialize in it it\&#39;s not the best However this was very respectable That being said I might not order it again I would probably go with one of their Greek specialties next time My sorority sister\&#39;s pizza looked very good and I do love a good pizza I had a sea breeze cocktail to wash down my ravioli The cocktail was okay- it could have been stronger but the flavors definitely blended well This is definitely a cool local Blacksburg spot! The Cellar has pretty solid food but the service is abysmal Very slow service and it can be extremely frustrating Sometimes it takes 15m to get asked for drinks 15m to ask what food we want and then 30 minutes to get the food The service is so slow so expect to be there for 2 hours in order to eat a mealThe food is great however Beer selection is top notch too Pizza is stellar maybe the best in Blacksburg Their sandwiches are great too Stop thinking about it and just GO The small pizzas are the perfect size for one person but the item on the menu are the calzones Order one in the basement bar have a beer and watch the locals and the college students Great atmosphere Great service and excellent food!! Could work on the crab cakes a bitthat\&#39;s coming from a girl from Virginia Beach :-) The red pepper and crab soup was awesome  Also had the special Salmon on spinach salad and it was great  Lots of extra stuff like olives and capers  Hardly needed any dressing Great Ambience and feel Fantastic Food! This place is highly recommended and is a lot less noisy and chaotic as some of the other bars in the vicinity The pizzas sandwiches and appetizers are all delicious Get their Pita Pizza or Spinach dip Great Beer selection! Great place for grad students and young professionals Blacksburg Staple Ok the food here is really good but the service is the WORSTI called in a take out order for a calzone and a gluten free pepperoni pizza I had to tell the guy taking the order what I wanted over and over before he got it (He sounded drunk) then he told me he didn\&#39;t know what it would cost because he wasn\&#39;t in front of his computer He also hung up without telling me how long the wait would beWhen my boyfriend and I arrive fifteen minutes later we went to the carry out shop and the guy told us we had to go downstairs to get our food We went down there and had to convince the bouncer to let us walk over to the register because we didn\&#39;t have our IDs (I don\&#39;t know why we have to be 21 to pick up our food) Then we were told it would be another ten minutes before our food was readyWhen we finally got our food home I discovered I\&#39;d gotten a gluten free pizza covered in jalapeo peppersno pepperoni I was so exhausted from the whole disaster that I couldn\&#39;t imagine going back!Also every time I go to the restaurant the staff is surly and it takes forever to get your food It\&#39;s a huge bummer this is the best gf pizza in town It may be college town type restaurant But I love the food There is so much variety and well developed recipes and daily specials I wished it were easier to find parking but most customers will be in walking range Great place to go if you want a college atmosphere with excellent food Every item I have picked out has been excellent We had a nice business lunch here and all four of us were impressed I got them to make me a Greek salad with gyro (instead of chicken) and it was huge and fresh Service was prompt and friendly (our waitress was from Russia) Great food but the service is so slow I used to frequent the cellar a lot but these last couple of times have literally taken me several hours I probably won\&#39;t go back anytime soon because the last time I was there it took me almost 3 hours for lunch THE BIGGEST FRICKING CALZONE! I posted a picture for reference This calzone is more like a family-sized chicken pot pie In some ways it is almost too big I know the disappointment of not finishing is countered by the jubilation of left-overs for lunch the next day However this foot-ball sized Italian beast is so huge that the crust to filling ratio is a little off I love cheese but it\&#39;s tough for me to eat a pound or two of it without plenty of breadOtherwise the calzone is very tasty The crust is AWESOME Crispy crunchy soft and flavorfulI think one of things I like most about the Cellar is the seating in the basement/&#34;Cellar&#34; It reminds me of an English pub with the plaster walls and dark lighting Roast beef and gravy really tasted homemade Somebody ordered the Fried chicken salad and it was gigantic All in all I think everybody in our party enjoyed their meal Killer beer selection too Friendly and relaxed atmosphere very tasty pizzas and a wonderful beer selection One of the spots around Blacksburg that I immediately became a fan of after visiting here We did not &#34;feel the love&#34; at The Cellar Service was pretty bad Food was decent / OK but not great We arrived just after the main dinner rush was clearing out so the waitress was not very busy We are pretty patient and laid back but there was no excuse for the waitress to introduce herself then ignore us for 20 minutes! Then ALL the food showed up at once! The appetizers soup salads and the main dishes! Really?? The Moussaka was really pretty good The salad and homemade squash soup were good The french dip was just OK (the beef jus tasted like it was from a can) The Calamari was not special Loads of bread served with everything if you like that We won\&#39;t go back There was absolutely no excuse to leave us hanging for so long when there were several waitresses and the place was half-empty I\&#39;ve never gone wrong at the Celler! Mary and I are frequent patrons First of all this place is attached to a six pack store that stocks beers and wines from local breweries and wineries as well as the best micro-brews in America But lets talk about the food if you were to ask me &#34;Joey what should i get at the Cellar?&#34; My emphatic answer would be &#34;The Greek Pita Pizza!&#34; These pizzas are made from pita dough and are 9&#34; in diameter great or a personal serving you can make it how you want it or choose from several pre-arranged pizzasIf i were to stray from the pita pizza rut I would suggest the Pasta Aegean Sauteed large shrimp over linguine pasta noodles tossed with feta cheese pesto tomatoes mushrooms garlic onions and spices sprinkled with parmesan cheese Wow! and its less than $10!Anyway this place is great for a group get together as well as a nice date night The Cellar is a happening place so you got to get there early to get a seat Up stairs is usually less crowded and aimed at dinner crowds while downstairs is the &#34;shady underbelly&#34; aimed toward groups of drinking buddies Both have there advantagesOverall If I had to pick the best place to get a meal and a brew in Blacksburg the Cellar would be at the top of that list Great food great people If you\&#39;re looking for something extremely fast plenty of fast food spots close by If you\&#39;re trying to relax with nice people great food chill atmosphere this is your spot 6-7pm $7 pitchers of any beer on draft Monday-Thursday amazing deal Okay where we come from a foot long meatball sub might have a total of eight meatballs on it half of this had about 10! The sauce was great the texture and freshness of the bread was perfect We weren\&#39;t able to eat half at one time and just finished off the subs we got Thursday on Saturday evening Great place I\&#39;ve been in Blacksburg for a long time and I\&#39;ve frequented the Cellar on multiple occasions Only recently have I had the pleasure of sitting at the bar while Samantha is on duty! She single-handedly turned around an otherwise unpleasant evening (I won\&#39;t get into it!) with attentiveness and grace Her knowledge of the area (and of creative ways to use flavored vodka ) were the highlight of our night Thanks Sam we\&#39;ll be back! Amazing every single time!!! Worth the wait friendly staff and really good food I think this is one of the better places in town The pizza was well made with good ingredients and prepared without too much grease or &#34;heavy&#34; additions - cheese etc were well balanced The waitstaff were great as always and the beer selection both draft and bottles in the store we\&#39;re varied enough to cover all tastes Love this place! The service is always fantastic and the food is phenomenal Cocktails are poured generously My boyfriend is a beer snob and he is always very pleased with their many offerings Also I am vegan and the Cellar\&#39;s menu has more than enough options that I can modify to suit my needs A Blacksburg jewel! The Cellar is an amazing place to get some good food and have a relaxed time They have especially good beer options on draft and a good range of IPAs! Definitely recommend this place no matter what day of the week The pita pizza is greatthe hummus appetizer is plenty for 5 or 6 people! Service was great even though they were really busy with Steppin Out folks seeking a break from the rain! The Cellar is not only a great place to go with your friends and family but also to take your dog They have an outside seating area that is great for small-medium sized dogs They bring a little bowl and water for them and they make sure everyone is comfortable and enjoying their time their I am definitely coming back with my puppy :) Okay I had to write an update because I\&#39;ve tried a few more items The Greek salad here is AMAZING Curly fries are A+ Chili is A+ Pizza is B+ Greek Spaghetti is C- and specials on beer are A+ Ambiance is fun and relaxed As long as you use common sense while ordering you should be happy here What an awesome pulled pork BBQ sandwich! And fantastic curly fries to go along with it I travel through the Southern US for work and Cellar had some of the best BBQ sauce I\&#39;ve had Virginia style with a bit of a kick--I asked for extra Great college-town atmosphere with a good looking beer selection as well This is a great place Parking was convenient $1 per hour at a meter We only had 45 minutes to eat sat outside ordered and asked waitress if we could make it Yep we sure did Unfortunately I made a mistake and only had 30 minutes so we were late anyway The food was delicious The special pizza of the day was a ratatouille which I had and another person ordered the fiesta pizza Both good the crust delicious but all the toppings slipped off both The other person in our group had the italian hoagie and that looked absolutely delicious he won for best order He assured us it was the best I like that it didn\&#39;t seem like a chain restaurant unlike all the others in the row Nice seating outside was really dark inside One of my favorite restaurants in Blacksburg My favorite (and first) dish I ever got there was the greek spaghetti It\&#39;s sooo delicious The spinach dip is also really good and comes with soft pitas I\&#39;ve had the calzone as well as the pizza and all are really goodI also really enjoy that they have the pitcher special of whatever beer you want for $7 such a great deal especially if you gather a group of friends and each get a pitcher if you go late night make sure you get there a little early because seating is tight downstairs and the ceiling isn\&#39;t very high I haven\&#39;t been to the new expansion but I think it\&#39;s a great idea A cute little spot convenient to the university We popped in on a Saturday night and hardly had to wait any time at all The space was cramped but that definitely added to the charm The food was amazing for the price and a good time was had by all It was unusually crowded during my last visit at the Cellar In spite of this my waitress provided great customer service She addressed the shortage of staff was apologetic about it and would try to come to our table to ask if we needed anything an impressive amount given how busy she looked She thanked my friend and I for our patience repeatedly and was generally professional the whole time In addition the food is always amazing and worth the wait I had the veggie sub with pasta salad on the side and my friend got the tortellini and garlic bread Both were absolutely delicious! The pita pizzas are also cheap and go well with their extensive selection of beer I highly recommend this restaurant for the attentive service and excellent food This review is for the beer store Last week I was visiting my girlfriend\&#39;s family in Blacksburg from San Diego and was looking to buy some beer I couldn\&#39;t get back home I decided to hit up the Cellar and I\&#39;m very very glad I did They have an excellent selection and fantastic staff I casually asked an employee if they had any more DuClaw SBJ in stock and he just ran down and restocked it immediately Then we had a great chat about beer and he gave some excellent recommendations Can\&#39;t wait to visit the girlfriend\&#39;s family again soon! Chose this restaurant because it had the traditional Greek awning Although I was very hesitant after looking at the menu which had very few Greek choices on the menu But what I did order was very good Classic Greek salad was good the stuffed grape leaf added a nice touch Stuffed grapes leaves should be added to menu Also ditch the carrots normally not part of a Greek saladThe chicken souvlaki was excellent Cooked to perfection seasoning was right on the mark This place is good they just need to stick with a true authentic Greek menu I Stopped by while in town for work College town atmosphere but my food was above what I expected The Greek salad was one of the best I ever had They add a small grape leaf which added class and flavor The pizza was crispy and awesone Fresh veggies and extras Highly recommended Just remember it is a college bar/grill when you see the decor All the food looked good on the other tables too Great place for craft beers and pretty good food Go for the hammer time or luck of the draw which is a $2 craft picked at random Makes me feel like I\&#39;m in a London pub downstairs The boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night for some dinner It was crowded but we found ourselves a seat soon enough Service- eh okay whatever Not great not bad Food- I ordered some kind of seafood pasta dish I can\&#39;t recall the name of- maybe the Aegean Pasta? It sounded delicious- shrimp and other seafood on top of linguini with pesto The bf ordered pizza (their specialty of sorts) The pizza was good The pasta was terrible There was plenty of seafood but it was SO BLAND Jeez Seriously I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;ve ever tasted anything so bland at a restaurant before Atmosphere- relaxed good place to grab beer with some friends I enjoy coming here for the shooters (downstairs bar area) with my girlfriends for a night out In short order the pizza get some beer get some shooters The kabobs are great Also the pizza It is BB\&#39;s graduate students bar and restaurant and it has very nice and friendly atmosphere on Friday and Saturday nights The Cellar is great Good drinks Good food I\&#39;ve never had a problem with customer service Really nice outside seating (weather permitting) and a really nice atmosphere inside (up and downstairs) This is my favorite bar in Blacksburg :) Great food Great bar for anyone to have a good conversation with friends and looking to avoid the craziness of tots or Hokie House My friends and I came back for a football weekend after a few years of being away and our trip to The Cellar did not disappoint Everyone loved the $2 &#34;Luck of the Draw&#34; that allows you to get a surprise beer - everyone at the table got something different because they have a great selection We had a delicious garlic bread appetizer some pizza baked ziti and more We sat upstairs but they also have outdoor seating - both have good ambiance and a great chance to people watch I agree with some of the other reviews that say the only drawback is slow service - while our waiter was really friendly and accommodating honestly the place was slammed and it was really a long wait to get our food Still worth it The Cellar is definitely my favorite place to eat and hang out in BlacksburgAtmosphere - The upstairs is more restaurant feeling and more family friendly They have live music there during the week They have a little area called the &#34;Champagne Room&#34; that\&#39;s a bit more private if you can manage to get it Downstairs is the tavern area where people go to have drinks and food in a more adult and casual setting I usually go downstairs at night and upstairs during the day They card in the tavern area later on during the night They have a big TV downstairs where they play sports The once smokey atmosphere is now gone as well which is very niceBeer and specials - They have a long list of beers to choose from and a recently opened section where they sell local microbrews I have yet to check it out but I\&#39;ve heard good thingsWeekdays 6-7pm is Hammertime where you get half off beers on Sundays they have deals on imported beers You can also do the &#34;Luck of the Draw&#34; where you pay a dollar for a random beer of their choosing I\&#39;ve usually gotten stuff on the lower end of things but its pretty fun to do and it\&#39;s only a buck!Drinks - Their drinks are always good not watered down and weak like in most places downtown Definitely worth going for drinks aloneFood - Always great I usually get the pita pizza which is a create your own pizza (you choose 3 ingredients) and is an awesome buy for around 5 bucks They totally fill you up or make for yummy leftovers I\&#39;ve also tried their sandwiches and subs always come out good and fill you up Their appetizers are also delicious - the hummus spinach and artichoke dips and their spanakopita\&#39;s are greatService - The one thing they\&#39;re not great at is service although they have greatly improved since I started going there You can expect to wait a bit especially if you\&#39;re downstairs You can also take it upon yourself to head to the bar and order if you\&#39;re feeling antsy and want your stuff sooner Upstairs they tend to come around more oftenBottom line - Definitely check them out if you\&#39;re in the \&#39;burg - it would be a sin not to! No alcohol outside until they get their ABC license amended Other than that everything was excellent They had about a 12oz prime rib dinner for 1699 Cheapest prime rib I have seen since the early 90\&#39;s and it was worth about twice what they charged for it The chicken pita was good as was the Greek pastaI wouldn\&#39;t eat outside after 3 PM in the Summer There is almost no protection from the late afternoon sun I love this place! My boyfriend and I can never decide where to go for dinner but with the large menu from American Italian and Greek selections we are always satisfied! The Crab Ravioli is delicious and the drink menu is great too! I was in the area for 3 nights I ate and drank at Cano Fish Taco the first night (great drinks and food) and here the second and third night After drinking my new favorite beer and eating the Habanero Chili and Chicken Souvlaki Kebabs I couldn\&#39;t bring myself to risk my last meal in VA so I returned No regrets I reccomend the Greek Pasta with Filet and either the Bell\&#39;s Oberon (new favorite) or the St Bernardus Tripel One of the best choices in town as far as food and atmosphere is concerned The live music most of the days is a considerable bonus especially is a small place like Blacksburg were choices are limited Their underground bar is also nice and cosy Huge selection of beer either draft or bottled which you can also buy in their liquer store adjacent to the bar A serious bonus is the late time you can have food which is really rare across the whole country!Main downside are the rude waitresses which are unfortunately the majority Service is not good most of the times and it makes you question if it\&#39;s worth giving a tip Also the food has nothing to do with Greek although labeled so The place used to be owned and operated by a Greek but during the last years it just has some Mediterranean touches (eg Humous pitas feta cheese) but has nothing to do with Greek cuisineOverall a place worth visiting when in Blacksburg especially on Thursdays when local bands make this place very lively! Delicious food and great prices! The pita pizzas are my go to but I\&#39;ve never had anything bad The crab dip and cucumber dip are both great as well At times the service is very slow but other times it\&#39;s reasonable As long as you have a little time it\&#39;s always a great place for lunch or dinner! I have eaten at the Cellar several times and the food is always good It does take some time to get your food so don\&#39;t come here if you are in a hurry The area inside is a little cramped and it can get a bit loud on weekends Decent food not as good as I remember from college then again my tastes have likely matured since then Truth be told we went during VT\&#39;s Spring Break so it likely wasn\&#39;t the A-squad in the kitchen and staffing Great beer list and they just opened a separate shop next door with an expanded carryout beer service - definitely worth checking out when you\&#39;re downtownThe food isn\&#39;t terribly adventurous but it\&#39;s all good and inexpensive Great little place  The food was mediocre and I was disappointed with the quality of their waitstaff service I\&#39;ll try it again because other locals told me that the service is typically excellent as is the food So perhaps this was just an anomaly I certainly liked their selections and the fact that they accommodate people with gluten allergies I love The Cellar! Yes they can have slow service at times but their food is great and inexpensive They also have great deals on drinks and pitchers of beer and cider The atmosphere is relaxing inside and they have great outdoor seating when the weather is nice It\&#39;s a great place to go after a long week and just relax It\&#39;s definitely one of my favorite places in all of Blacksburg The consistency to greatness is lacking You can never ever go wrong with a pita pizza; everything else takes to long to sometimes justify but some things are worth it The beer selection is superb and maybe the best in town A must try for any newbie and the lunch specials are worth a stop Just don\&#39;t be in a rush when you go to the Cellar Everyone is laid back The cellar is another one of my favorite go to restaurants in blacksburg! Great drink selection and a huge menu of reasonably priced foods They have a fun lower bar area an upstairs dining room and an outdoor patio when the weather is nice Their dips are great to start out with and the pizzas are always delicious They have a variety of sandwiches and entrees as well as a decent amount of seafood options which is rare in southwest virginia This place is definitely worth a visit for casual dining Good food not very good service! Pizzas dips and beers are my fav ones here! Super crowded during weekends Hate to give this place only two stars because the food was very goodbut the service just took away from our whole experience Maybe they just had a bad day or someone called out sick But we moved our daughter into Tech walked over for lunch (fairly early 11:45) and did not have anyone approach us for about 20 minutesthen waited another 15 minutes to orderanother 30 minutes to receive our appetizeranother 20 minutes to get our meals which were great but took about an hour and half to reach our table!! I think things were made worse for the fact that it was like 100 degrees (literally) and everyone was so hot and tiredwe really just wanted some cold water and to grab a quick lunch and neither occurred We literally had to ask one of the other waitresses if they forgot us as others who came after us were served before us and were long gone It looked like an inside waitress was given one outside table and kind of forgot about us After sitting there again for awhile we asked if someone was going to wait on us and bugged her again to see if our meals were ordered and later had to actually go inside to find our waitress to see if we could get more water and our bill because no one had come around in so long My recommendation to the restaurant would be to have your outside waitresses do outside (they were moving things along doing a good job) and your inside waitresses do insideand to have someone overseeing the wait staff to make sure people are being taken care ofit\&#39;s really too bad because the food was greatand we have five more years at Tech to come visit and eat[disappointed] If I\&#39;m heading out with fellow graduate students and transplants to this area we are likely headed to the Cellar In the summer it\&#39;s a great place to sit outside and watch the world of Blacksburg go by During the school year the restaurant and bar is frequented by graduate students faculty and families from the area The cellar has an upstairs restaurant which has live music from local tallent many evenings The bar in the basement is our favorite place to get dinner and a few drinks The menu differs by 4 ( i think) items The upstairs restaurant serving the 4 extra items which includes chicken parmesan Food &amp; Drink: They have the best beer selection in town both on tap and in bottles or cans We often eat the Salmon Spinach Salad - it\&#39;s huge and has a great selection of vegetables The pizza is also delicious and they have many gluten free options I also love the pasta - I often get it plain with a butter sauce and garlic They are very flexible to your food desires and the staff is very accommodating and nice Overall a great place to get some good food and have a great time with friends!Separate from the restaurant and bar is the Cellar 6-pack store which sells tons of specialty beers - a must visit! Just went down to the cellar and got two soups Both were half way full but I got charged full price This is really unacceptable I called and complained Jeff was quite rude on the phone asking me what I wanted him to do about it This is the typical story with the cellar Food is pretty good Service is consistently awful I won\&#39;t be going backUpdate: After getting a yelp comment from the restaurant\&#39;s owner I sent him an email He was very receptive to my concerns and offered a gift card to his restaurant I think this was the appropriate way to handle the situation No one wants to feel like they were cheated out of a meal so I was glad he understood He also said he had spoken with his employees and they are working to improve their service I have not been back to notice but I am willing to try The Cellar again! The food is consistently pretty good My main complaints have always been regarding the service but maybe they will be able to get some better people working in the restaurant and improve things I am optimistic after my email exchange with the restaurant owner He seemed like a good guy! Although it is true that this place is geared toward a more &#34;adult&#34; clientele instead of the typical undergraduate student at VT this place leaves much to be desired I wasn\&#39;t coming expecting much and I received just about that It took the two waiters who were serving the entire first floor about 45 minutes to ask us if we wanted drinks After we ordered it was about another hour before the food came albeit the server had to admit one order did not come out because he dropped the pizza on the floor I realize that this is a hangout joint but really do you have the time to &#34;hangout&#34; there for four-five hours on a Friday night? I\&#39;d rather be somewhere where the waiters don\&#39;t constantly clumsily bump into you and/or your chair; where the place doesn\&#39;t reek like cigarette smoke; where the floors weren\&#39;t so greasy that the waiters actually slipped around like a slip and slide This place was dark and dingy If that is &#34;adult&#34; I\&#39;d rather go to any of the other many restaurants lining that same road The food - wasn\&#39;t much better than the ambience of the place I got the &#34;Mad Greek&#34; I wonder if it would be better if it were the &#34;Happy Greek&#34; The meat (all 3 thin slices) was extremely dry; the yogurt sauce was like tart mayonnaise water and everything else was basically filler to make you feel like you got your money\&#39;s worth Two surprising notes which saved this place form the one star - the bread for the sandwich was good Good yeast was used in the preparation and it was very moist on the inside and light and crunchy on the outside Another thing the bathroom was extremely clean although you notice that there is only a door vent that goes straight back into the main dining area A great restaurant A wide selection at reasonable prices with a fantastic beer menu I visit here at least once every time I revisit Blacksburg One star for the beer selection and half price import bottle SundayOne star for the staff; they are among the best for milesZero stars for for the food Poor execution with industrial ingredients Very popular annoyingly large menu (good thing I don\&#39;t need it) now with two kitchens!Patio and carry-out craft beer store would earn an additional half star if food wasn\&#39;t so offensive Live music same thing Great bands but oh well People eat it but then again people also invented plastics and nerve gas Way to go People The wait staff Mallory was informative and delightful She knew the menu items was laudatory of them and helpful with our selections She checked back with just right number of times She\&#39;s a great ambassador for the restaurant In fact we were guests to the town and told out relatives meeting us here to go to The Cellar The food was tasty and a good value Good pizza good beer occasional live music The Cellar is a good time Cellar is one of my go to restaurants in Blacksburg It has a great atmosphere and good food while being reasonably priced Hammer time is a fantastic deal only $7 for a pitcher of any of the draft beers They also have a great beer selection probably second only to Rivermill Very attentive and nice staff I got a salad and a pint for lunch while wandering around town one weekend The food is average quality and reasonably priced A bit noisy though but nice to have the option to eat outside Fun casual spot    perfect for a college town Good selection of beers salads pizzas pastas and the like Large portions reasonably priced Friendly service Four-star rating is because it\&#39;s a fun spot - the food is not exceptional but decent and dependable - good for a casual hang-out in a college town I love this place for several reasons1-The atmosphere If you\&#39;re like me and looking to escape the hordes of undergraduates the cellar is a good place to go The crowd is a bit older but still young enough to be lively I\&#39;d recommend the bar in the basement for a late night place to hangout The service can be a bit slow but the servers are also the bartenders so how hard of a time can you really give them? They work hard and they\&#39;re generally pretty friendly if you talk to them 2-The food It won\&#39;t knock your socks off because of its originality but it is consistently good It\&#39;s the only place in Blacksburg that has a good Rueben (that I\&#39;ve found anyway) The pita pizzas are good too and are reasonably priced for a light dinner I\&#39;ve liked pretty much everything I\&#39;ve had here except for the steaks which are usually on special but are too thin and overcooked  3-The drinks A really good beer selection both draught and in bottles They also do mixed drinks well The wine isn\&#39;t very good but it\&#39;s not the type of place where I\&#39;d generally order wine anyway Great beer selection Good pizza Decent bar fare My kind of joint Very low key casual almost dive-y One of my top 3 places to eat in town Would definitely recommend eating during a time that there\&#39;s a special (50% off total check isn\&#39;t uncommon at times when you hit the right promotional period)Italian dishes are very authentic tasting and the lasagna always seems homemade The &#34;Hammertime&#34; special is tough to beat ($6 any pitcher 6 pm - 7 pm Monday-Thursday) $5 lunch specials are an extremely good deal (on great food)Service is typically snail-like downstairs but I\&#39;ve avoided that by eating upstairs where the staff seems to be much more attentive (some may prefer the more relaxed atmosphere downstairs though) Good food great prices worst service in the areaI\&#39;ve gone to The Cellar for many years I used to love them because of their phenomenal gluten-free options (beers pizza sandwiches more) Over the past year service has gotten worse and worse from annoyingly forgetful to accidentally serving me non-gluten-free items and lately to being completely rude The food doesn\&#39;t even begin to make up for the awful service anymore I won\&#39;t be returning and I wouldn\&#39;t recommend them to anyone anymore Great staff huge selection of beer and the pizza was pretty damn tasty Great happy hour specials 1/2 off pints 7-9 and half off imports on Sundays My boyfriend and I have made it a tradition to go every Sunday for the imports Our goal is to try to have everything on the list By far my favorite place for beer in town!Food is good The pita pizzas are good and a fantastic deal at $575 (you can also find coupons for the pita pizzas just about everywhere so we always get them for $499) A pita pizza and a beer is one of my favorite Blacksburg meals Also their dips are pretty fantastic They are a little pricey ($8-$9) for appetizers but the portions are pretty largeIts a great place for all types Upstairs has a great family atmosphere and downstairs (in &#34;the cellar&#34; lol) is great for the adults I\&#39;ve been here a few times and I\&#39;m really not sure why I ever go back It\&#39;s a Greek and &#34;Italian&#34; kind of hybrid restaurant They occasionally have a cool Southern style band come in and play live music which is a great cultural experience for someone who\&#39;s not from the area They have a very good beer selection and some good value options Service at this place is pretty nonexistant though You pretty much seat yourself and if the wait staff happens to notice that you exist then they come and begrudgingly take your order They rarely ever check up on you to see if you need anything and good luck getting them to bring you a check Odds are you\&#39;ll have to flag someone down yourself They have 1 single unisex bathroom which isn\&#39;t exactly kept to the most hygienic of standards If you want to go and sit at the bar to watch a game -- good luck No one in that place has any idea as to how to operate their TV The subtitles have been streaming on the one TV for about a year and half now without sound It\&#39;s an issue that the ownership just seems to not notice or ignore They also seem to have an ant issue because every time that I sit at the bar I always notice an ant or two stroll by       The first time I went I ordered the Mousakka which was a menu special for that particular day Their\&#39;s consisted of eggplant ground beef cheese and sausage all sort of layered together I love all of those ingredients individually so I thought why not They bring you a plate of it which is a solid 6 inches thick and was clearly baked in the oven The result the interior is ice cold while the tops and sides are piping hot When I came back months later I ordered the baked ziti with meatballs something I had been craving I was expecting a nice plate of ziti with a few meatballs on top and the whole thing coated with mozzarella cheese Instead I get the baked ziti with meatballs Mousakka style! It was a 6 inch thick lasagna looking dish that even had the meatballs inside of it This time though I had the opposite issue The exterior was burnt while the interior was warm The meatballs were comparable to the ones that you buy at Subway or some lousy sub shop They are absolutely clueless when it comes to cooking Italian style food or running a restaurant in general Mediocre cheese fries and they don\&#39;t have scrabble But it\&#39;s okay because they have lots of beer Good food always in a relaxed if noisy atmosphere The wait staff can be slow but isn\&#39;t alwaysThe food here is typical American/Italian and the beer selection is very good It\&#39;s a friendly place to take the kids even and it won\&#39;t break the bank if you watch what you choose I wouldn\&#39;t go downstairs though unless you want the typical college bar experience Upstairs is a nice if crowded sit down place with mirrors on both walls that make it look bigger Their chef/s do a good job and their pasta is good Some entrees are from frozen ingredients though and you can tell if you know what to look for but they still taste good Their pita pizza is some of the best pizza in the NRV and I\&#39;ve had a lot around the areaThe beer selection is top of the line both on-tap and in bottles I don\&#39;t really know about the rest of their drink selection as I haven\&#39;t had it for over a decade Happy hour is at a nice price point and their dollar bottled beer special has never steered me wrong You can\&#39;t be cheaper than that for beerThe noise can get high at times due to the crowds sometimes the live band and the reverberant walls/mirrors but it\&#39;s never gotten deafening or hurtfulThe wait staff can be slow; they have to take care of two floors of people - the bar downstairs and the more normal restaurant upstairs I feel the cooks are likely responsible for some of the delays too for similar reasons But I\&#39;ve only had to ask them to hurry up once They haven\&#39;t been slow all the time either My suggestion is to arrive early about 5 or 5:30 and it will speed things up Also Fridays and Saturdays are slower IMOIf you watch what you order you can get by for about $45 for two kids and two adults including tip That\&#39;s with beer Of course if you order dessert or buy more expensive entrees it can go over $50 If everyone gets pita pizza and water it will be less For this economy that\&#39;s a really good dealThe food is a solid three stars but the beer and price make it worth four Of course the beer selection is one of the best in town As far as food goes though it\&#39;s not too shabby The lunch deal with the pita pizza is the perfect size for me I have tried some sandwiches and they are good My favorite thing there is the calzone but it is LARGE You will probably have to want to eat calzone leftovers if you order one Somewhat recently they have added outdoor sidewalk seating This is a great place for after hours during the warm months I continue to love The Cellar as it\&#39;s pretty much the only place in Blacksburg to get good beer but the service really is pretty terrible and they are consistently out of food items or beer It seemed like every beer we ordered was unavailable and then we couldn\&#39;t help but laugh when they told us they were out of stuffed shells The waitstaff is friendly but they take forever Not an issue if you\&#39;re in no hurry and just want to hang out with friends but if you\&#39;re looking for an efficient meal I\&#39;d stay away because just coming for dinner can turn into a multi-hour marathonI also would love it if they could improve the ventilation downstairs as the cigarette smoke can be overwhelming at times Great food at good prices The pita pizzas are fast cheap and delicious If you\&#39;re looking for a place to relax and meet a few friends for a drink head downstairs to the cellar bar Less crowded/noisy than the other college bars in the area Food: The service is kind of slow because it\&#39;s usually pretty crowded but the food is usually worth the wait My favorite is the greek veggie sub It\&#39;s amazing Their pasta and dips are also good too Drinks: HAMMERTIME = best thing ever From 6-7pm on Thursday you can come in and get a pitcher of any beer that they have whether it\&#39;s domestic or imported for $550 It\&#39;s amazingOverall: The Cellar is GREAT and from time to time you may catch a glimpse of the legendary John Boyer Fantastic food good music upstairs great martinis and welcoming staff The only negative is that the basement is very smokyIf you want a martini but don\&#39;t know what to order tell the bartender what kind of flavor you\&#39;re craving and you will get a one of a kind Their Pita Pizzas are delicious I suggest going on Thursday evening and enjoying six dollar pitchers during hammertime Bartender was great (working 10/16) and the beer selection was wonderful Food was good as well as always This was our fav dive when here in schoolwas here 35 years later and it\&#39;s till terrific Great beer selection good pub food good service I still love it! The Cellar was my favorite restaurant in downtown Blacksburg and one of the few that I really miss since having moved away I ate there frequently during my time as a student at Virginia Tech Their pita wedge with dip appetizers are to die for the crab cheese dip being my absolute favorite!Their sandwiches and pizzas are very good too and their pasta dishes were amazing! Definitely one of the more &#34;mature&#34; feeling places to dine in the college town The upstairs area is well-lit and great for lunch of a quiet dinner with friends (they often have live music) and the downstairs basement area is good for when you want to enjoy dinner and drinks with a larger group of friends This &#34;cellar&#34; area is pretty dark and usually very rowdy though so be forewarnedThe service is sometimes very slow but this is due to the fact that they are usually pretty busy -- a testament to their great food and popularity LOVE The Cellar If you want to have a thoughtful conversation over a delicately prepared entree this isn\&#39;t the place If your main goal in a bar is to guzzle as much bud lite in for as cheap as possible this is also not the place for you The real star at the Cellar is BEER It\&#39;s a place for people who love good beer and their wine list is growing too They have a huge draft list with lots of artisan/craft domestics along with imports It used to be the best place to get New River Pale Ale draft (RIP) :(Upstairs at the Cellar on a week-night can be a nice place to have a conversation plus live music several nights a week Downstairs is always smoky crowded noisy but wonderfully cozy When you keep running into your art/art history professors down there you know you\&#39;re in the right place Around Hammertime the place gets packed If you were thinking about eating during hammertime you are wrong Just getting a pitcher might take 20 min It\&#39;s worth it if you get their early and snag a table for your group of friends You can get a large pitcher for $6 of something that might normally cost $10 or $12 A whole lot of the entrees and pastas are pre-frozen nothing special Don\&#39;t bother with having them de-frost a piece of cheesecake for you either Pizzas are pretty good try the Mexican or the Cellar House Special pizza Subs meh Pita and French Bread pizzas are a great deal and tons of food Aside from recent arrivals like Cafe de Bangkok the Cellar is as close to &#34;real people&#34; (aka not a bunch of stupid frat guys) as Blacksburg gets The pita pizzas are a good deal $5 for a pizza that can be 2 meals! The subs are also pretty decent there However the service is generally slow and sometimes forgetful! I ordered a ginger ale with my meal once and it never came! And I still got charged for it! The moussaka was ehhh the baklava was so-so the beer selection was decent I used to choose this place cause they are the only ones who served Flying Dog Ales but now Rivermill has that as well Awesome food badass service Atmosphere is fun and laid back So much beer! Great selection of foreign and domestic beers and always great food Open Mic nights are always a personal favorite too! A Blacksburg staple Best place to eat and drink in town great food beer and service I\&#39;m a big fan of The Cellar They have yummo food and a great beer selection The pita pizzas are amazeballs but don\&#39;t forget the rest of the menu The salads pastas soups I like them all My favorite was artichoke and roasted red pepper bisque but I haven\&#39;t seen it back on the menu in years The atmosphere is low-key until you hit the live music night I do love going there but service can be slow at times Ah you must try the cucumber dip with warm pita chips it too is delicious The pita pizzas here are amazing I can\&#39;t comment on any other food they serve because the first time I went I ordered a pita pizza and every time after that I did the same The atmosphere is cute and cozy the wait staff friendly though a bit slow and the food is wonderful It is noisy and dark but they have great food Their eggplant parmesan is to die for Their baklava is something special--one time they were out of it because the old lady who makes it was snowed in--wow! I always tried to hit up the cellar with my friends Thursday nights because they have $7 pitchers of any kind of beer on tap! I\&#39;ve never eaten here before so I\&#39;m not sure how the food is The cellar\&#39;s a cool place to hang This place has the biggest balls of meat I\&#39;ve ever seen!!! The beer specials and good pizza make this a solid place especially to avoid the typical Blacksburg undergrad crowd The service is hit-or-miss which is frustrating especially when you know how good it could be don\&#39;t remember much from my two visits here the food was average one thing that i do remember was very very very slow service  it took forever to get our drinks  it took forever to order our food  we got real hungry waiting for the food  and took another 25 minutes to get our checks  So this place has amazing food and the proportions are huge for great prices I especially love their cucumber dip It\&#39;s always fresh and goes well with pita chips or the spanakopitas They also have an amazing crap and shrimp dip that is sometimes spicy but good but something not spicy at all Not real sure why it\&#39;s so variable BUT it\&#39;s always goodTheir best alcohol deal is Luck of the Draw You pay 1$ for a beer of their choosing I\&#39;ve always had good beer with this deal Ohhhh but man has their service went way downhill In the last couple of months I\&#39;ve had horrible service everytime I went They are super super slow One night I was downstairs and I was trying for about 45 minutes to pay for my beer I must have asked each bartender 5 times to bring the check Finally I just gave up and walked out I felt a little guilty for walking out but I didn\&#39;t have all night to sit there and wait for them to get their act together And then most recently our table ordered a pizza some soup and cucumber dip with pita bread The soup and cucumber dip came out fast but then all of a sudden we were waiting for 35 minutes to get our pizza The server never questioned why the tables that arrives after us were receiving their food before us Needless to say we finally got his attention and said we didn\&#39;t want the pizza and that we wanted the checks So we told him which food belonged to which people and which card to charge He got this wrong and charged the wrong amounts on each cardI\&#39;m not so sure if I\&#39;ll be going back It just seems like they need new managers or something to fix the service Good place for cheap beer and huge plates of food with many vegetarian selections - I wouldn\&#39;t make a special trip to eat there (I live ~1 hour away) but pop in when I\&#39;m in town great beer list and happy hour specials the servers are busy but generally attentive great pita wedges too! The service was good and the food was great! I really enjoyed the steak very tasty and tender The side veggies mushroom red yellow peppers and grilled zucchini were awesome! This is a new favorite hangout now whenever we come visit VT Love the atmosphere and the Brazilian fare! Wonderful sauces to select with the steaks! The bean dishes are full of spicy flavor! This is not your typical hole in the wall college restaurant Right outside of downtown this authentic Brazilian cuisine will have your taste buds jumpingI ordered the estrogonofe with a side of grilled pineapple The beef had so much flavor and the rice was lightly buttered with a hint of perfect!!I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a different course of meal in a college town Gaucho Brazilian Grille is a wonderful affordable steakhouse with lots of tasty options The chicken hearts are delicious and can be ordered as an add-on to the entree at 3-4 dollars I got their square meal which is a set meal with veggies rice beans and choice of protein I chose the house-made sausage and it was tasty with good seasoning The rice and salad in the square meals were wonderful as well! I also ordered the tapioca dices I love them! They are sticky inside and crispy outside and taste amazing with the spiced ketchup sauce! Really a pleasant surprise once again thanks to the Yelpers that steered us to it Extensive menu with lots of unique items on it My wife started with a traditional Brazilian drink -? - passion fruit based that she really liked The starters ranged from pretty basic ( plantains) to very unique ( gaucho bacon - aka sweetbreads) I had the combination greens potato salad pickled veggies as an appetizer ( from the side dish menu) and it was good! For the main course my wife had the Brazilian stroganoff - it had great flavor and closely resembled other stroganoffs she has had I had the picanha (sirloin steak) with chimi-rice Steak was good - not great but the chimi-rice was amazing Their potato sticks side was also fantasticOne of our friends ordered off of the vegetarian menu and raved about the portobello mushroom and sweet onionsReasonably priced on top of it all I have never had Brazilian food and this place is absolutely a hidden gem I was in the area for a work trip and was recommended to go to this spot by a coworker We had two appetizers the Dado de Tapioca and the Provolera The tapioca is a fried cheese bread which is sweet decadent crispy and gooey all at once Isabella suggested it with the Agridoce a guava sauce that was spicy and rich and perfect Provolera sounds strange but you will NOT be disappointed (try it with the guava sauce )I tried the Gaucho beer which was interesting and did not disappoint It\&#39;s like a wheat beer with an earthy taste; light flavorful and different from anything I\&#39;ve ever had! I wish I had a growler handy to take this stuff home with me For dinner we shared a half order of Moqueca and added a side of black beans and fried plantains Even a half order between two people was plenty! Everything was cooked perfectly and although the ingredients don\&#39;t sound like they go together it\&#39;s like having a bit is So Paulo in your mouth I\&#39;m not typically a dessert person but I couldn\&#39;t pass it up after all this goodness! Pudim de Leite is similar to a Mexican flan it wasn\&#39;t overly sweet and was the smoothest flan I\&#39;ve ever had Isabella gave us a taste of the Brazilian fudge as well which is TO DIE for I will absolutely be finding any possible excuse to have work bring me back to Gaucho Grille! Hands down one of the best meals I\&#39;ve had in a very long time Everything was cooked to perfection! The jasmine rice was phenomenal and surprisingly simple Wonderfully authentic and flavorful It\&#39;s a good thing I don\&#39;t live here because I would be here daily! Make sure you ask for Alec! He is incredibly knowledgeable about the offerings and made some great suggestions (and some great drinks! ) My niece and I visited Gaucho\&#39;s on a Thursday night while staying in Blackburg for college visits The food was delicious Our waiter was very helpful in making suggestions as I was unfamiliar with the cuisine Good food friendly and helpful service Good mealLocation - a very short safe walk (on sidewalks) from the Hyatt My wife and I came here on an impromptu dinner date before coffee with friends Everything we had was absolutely delicious and the atmosphere was relaxing I loved the black beans and the steak was perfect Our server was attentive but wasn\&#39;t hovering We will definitely be back Have been there so many times Love the service and the food My favorite is the sobrecoxa with the chimichurri sauce and the potato salad I like their steak and the Kielbasa sausage beans stew as well Overall it\&#39;s one of my favorite places in Blacksburg My husband and I love this place for date night- it\&#39;s our go to! Great atmosphere- friendly staff and food/drinks are always on point Parking maybe limited in front of the restaurant but there is additional parking at the back It\&#39;s located right behind Starbucks On busy nights it may be good idea to call ahead and make reservations- we\&#39;ve always lucked out but it definitely fills up quick! Great place for a quick lunch date- I met up with an old BumbleBFF friend who was in town for her fall break and we had a great time Food was delicious and the employees were very helpful My boyfriend and I are new to the area and have been working our way through all the fun places to eat then we finally got the chance to try this place and we weren\&#39;t disappointed Great atmosphere and decor our waiter was kind enough to give us a tour of the whole menu since we had never dined here before and even give us his favorites which was extremely helpful Also since we were sitting at a high top in the bar area we got to watch all the meat get grilled up on the huge open grille which was cool The food was absolutely delicious the meat tender and juicy and the sides were flavorful with a ton of different options We will definitely be back to try more of the fun choices on the menu! The food is excellent This was the best meal I had while on a 5 day trip to the area Smells good But that\&#39;s all our family of 5 could experience Walk in lady hardly greets us ask for a table says&#34;No we don\&#39;t have any&#34; Ok&#34;Like for the night?&#34; &#34;Well we have a large reservation&#34; &#34;Well how long until one may be available?&#34; &#34;You guys can come back and try later&#34; What?! &#34;Do you guys do like a waiting list?&#34; Fortunately another guy chimes in and says it may be like an hour to hour and a half &#34;Ok no thanks&#34;I would definitely look at getting a better system or greeter for the door What a lovely taste of Brazil in Blacksburg Not only is the service friendly and quick but the food and drinks are delicious I ordered the 5oz sirloin with yucca fries and house salad The chef actually prepares the steaks properly (imagine ordering rare and it actually comes out rare unlike a lot of restaurants that over cook perfectly tasty steaks) and the seasonings used are both simple and delicious that accentuate the natural flavors rather than mask them The Gaucho appetizer platter was also tasty and the chimichurri was a great add to the steak and fries This is a keeper (especially for the price point) Highly recommend to check out their online menu before going if you are not familiar with Brazilian food as the on-line version presents you pictures for better visualization (but be aware that discrepancy may exist For example my corcovado did not contain green leaves but the online menu has) Located just around the corner of a Starbucks Food taste good in general but is a little pricey compared to the portion Also not sure if Brazillian style is pretty close to American style I didn\&#39;t feel strongly any unique Brazillian flavor Anyway a good place to have some high-tier food in Blacksburg Gaucho has some of the best food in Blacksburg and provides a nice environment for great company The service is attentive really makes your experience that much better For dinner I created my own plate I ordered the 5oz Picanha (steak) and the 6oz Manns (sausage) I ordered my steak rare and it was cooked perfectly just as I expected it! Some places tend to overcook your meat but I was surprised that they didn\&#39;t I also got brie cheese on top of the steak with a size of zucchini garlic bread with the chimichurri sauce I have to say that this was one of the best meals I have had in Blacksburg; but with great quality it was a little expensive (my wallet is crying) DEFINITELY get the brie cheese on one of your meats; you won\&#39;t regret it! The steak was delicious and the sausage was amazing as well Again I seriously recommend you get brie cheese it makes your meal so much tastier!! The chimichurri sauce adds a lot of flavor in each bite tooI highly recommend bringing someone here for a cute date or if you are craving steak/meat The atmosphere caters towards a romantic date and the service adds onto that This restaurant is really lowkey too I don\&#39;t think it will get crowded But if you want to play it safe having reservations would not hurt Tonight\&#39;s dinner only qualifies for 1 star but I\&#39;ll give it 2 We went here last year that experience was much better I\&#39;ve been to different sorts of Brazilian restaurants whether it\&#39;s churrascaria style or plated Not only our steak we wanted to order they no longer carry so we just decided to get the Picanha which is Brazilians specialty sirloin So disappointed not only did my husband order the 10oz for 2995 and that\&#39;s just the steak Salad black beans and rice he ordered was a la carte crazy The steak he had was tough too tough not very good quality meat My 5oz Picanha was $1795 just the steak I ordered the rice and eggplant topped with mozzarella also a la carte My favorite thing on my plate was a small portion of eggplant topped with mozzarella We definitely don\&#39;t mind paying more for our steak which we have but this was definitely the worst steak we\&#39;ve ever had Now mind you we live in Yorktown we came up and drove over 4 hours to surprise my stepson for his 20th Birthday just to have dinner with him and we picked this restaurant to celebrate it in because of the meal experienced we had last year We were actually excited to come back Boy was that a disappointment Another thing we brought our own cake to give to him we asked if we can have small plates to serve the cake in there\&#39;s a $10 charge for usage of the plates Wow if that didn\&#39;t &#34;top the icing on the cake&#34; pun intended We decided not to do the cake there That\&#39;s ridiculous really a charge for using the plates??? That covers it needless to say we won\&#39;t be coming back again And we don\&#39;t recommend it Walked in with a group of 8 and it took us 30 mins to be noticed by the staff We thought the service had finally improved when our waiter took our glasses for refillsbut that\&#39;s all he did was take our glasses Completely forgot to return with our cups and I didn\&#39;t get hold of him until 20 mins later Took 90 mins to get our food because there was one guy cooking I ordered the moqueca which was really underwhelming Others ordered steak which came out as tough as hockey pucks The quality of meat was subbb-parr We didn\&#39;t even order desserts because we were afraid we would never get out of there This restaurant is vastly over rated There are plenty of better options in the area Very relaxed atmosphere Service was appropriately attentive I had the chicken leg and rice and beans It was well presented Adequate portion As for it being Brazilian I have no point of reference The chicken was tasty I was assured by the owner that there was no food additives or taste enhancers in any of the food Good to know Best kept secret in Blacksburg! Excellent service fantastic food great music and the bar is great! I recommend anything on the menu I got the chicken and shrimp Moqueca Absolutely delicious meal at a great value My husband got a steak and was pleased with everything! I highly recommend this place Tche! Had dinner here on a Saturday night after Graduation at VTech Food was excellent 6 people We all ordered appetizers and different dishes and shared We thoroughly enjoyed it all Decor was bright and clean Good selection of beer and wine Everyone was friendly and helpful I would give it 5 stars but the service was slow Granted it was Graduation If I could I would give them a 49 But I just can\&#39;t give them a perfect score Overall: 35 starsGood not great food that is very expensive Nice environment with plenty of seating inside and parking area around the shopping complex No problems/complaints with the service The food quality itself is not bad but I do not plan on returning mainly due to the price of each menu item Food Quality: 3 starsOrdered the Tapas Tour Ximango Picanha Sandwich and Picanha Salad In general the food was above average but did not think it was worth $40 First the Tapas Tour came with three Dado de Tapioca and three Banana Frita instead of the Aipim Frito (Yucca) as they ran out by the time I got there around 8:15 PM Both the Dado de Tapioca and Banana Frita were good as the flavor complimented the Chimichurri dipping sauce As for the Ximango Picanha Sandwich the Picanha steak was dry and overcooked despite being cooked at medium The sandwich was difficult to eat with my hands so ate it with a fork and knife instead Ordered the Chimichurri dipping sauce again which was a good idea Overall the sandwich was kind of bland and dry same goes with the Picanha Salad Service/Experience: 4 starsAside from the food quality the overall experience at Gaucho Grille was great First there is plenty of parking around the shopping complex and seating area inside the restaurant The environment is nice with a modern design as half the restaurant is a bar/tall seating and the other devoted to dining The servers were quick to get us our drinks and orders in and did not hesitate to explain the full menu as it was my first time dining at Gaucho Grille They checked on us frequently filled our waters and got us our checks quickly Only downside to the restaurant is the limited hours (5:30 PM - 9:30 PM) and that they ran out of Yucca by the time I got there which was 8:15 PM Food so good that you\&#39;re sad when you\&#39;re done We\&#39;ve been here three or four times and the food has always been wonderful All of the beef selections have been perfectly prepared and all of the sides have been greatMost of the tables have a view of the grill so you cam watch the artistry happen The beer wine and spirits selections are not huge but all of them are good and are chosen to pair with the food One of our favorite places in Blacksburg Amazing food hearty and well prepared A few suggestions are the an appetizer of fried Yuca or Croustinis Had a Pichana steak square meal with Chimichuri sauce Best seasoned steak in the area The atmosphere is nice and it appears that it is a family owned and run and the family seems to work well together Cheers So where do I begin ? Could it be the deliciously lightly crisped yuca with the amazing dipping sauces or the ximango which is a Brazilian picanha steak sandwich with Vidalia onions garlic bread and provolone one word YUMMY ! This was paired with the Gaucho tour that consisted of kielbasa picanha steak pork loin and chicken thigh with four dipping sauces: chimichurri red hot agridulce and garlic mayo Simply put all of the meats were perfectly prepared and exceptionally seasonedI highly recommend the food and don\&#39;t forget to pair with a nice house wine First time going and menu looked nice Well after we ordered we were told they had run out of sirloin They serve 3 types of beef Sirloin ribeye and short ribs We paid for the glass of wine and left Awesome first impression Awesome place for dinner! My favoriate dish is always been smoked sausage with herbal source The waiters in there are friendly and nice Great dinning atmosphere for couples friends and families I highly recommend this place Every time we are in Blacksburg this is a go to destination not only is the staff friendly the food is tasty and made to order Wonderful ambiance and the garlic sauce out of this world! The bean stew and rice along with the eggplant are tasty So sorry that the stewed yuca was taken off the menu but the owner told me how to prepare it at home! How wonderful she shared her recipe with me! Great restaurant! It\&#39;s a typical college town restaurant where decor is generic and functional Food was excellentfantastic 10 piece tapas appetizerand my create-your-own ribeye was perfect The sides of grilled zucchini and portobella provolone were very smokey and flavorful But why 4 star\&#39;s? My server was bad not quick with water and got my colleague\&#39;s mix drink wrong He couldn\&#39;t give me a second copy of the receipt cuz the receipt machine is saving paper?! Also no salt and pepper on the tableall of them were stacked by the waiters station During our couple-day stay here we decided to go to this place after my boyfriend raved about it last time he had visited Blacksburg There was no wait on a weekend which was great for a party of 8 If you\&#39;re a fan of chicken hearts I can tell you the chicken heart square meal did not disappoint Honestly the rice and beans etc were also really good too! I would\&#39;ve eaten all of it had we not gotten the dado de tapioca (this was sooo good! a bit chewy because of the tapioca but really addicting with the cheese too) The chimichurri sauce (you get to choose what sauce you want) is solid garlic-y and addicting I would\&#39;ve gotten a whole bowl of it if I could! Staff was really nice gave us suggestions and answered questions that we had The flan was also really good and a great way to end dinner I\&#39;d say it\&#39;d be enough to share one with 2 people (or a few bites between a couple people) The food is not bad here It\&#39;s pretty good actually The reason why I am giving this 2 stars is because of price to sanctification ratio You pay around $30 for a steak the size of a stack of cards and a small amount of sides To add insult to this they give you a tiny bit of sauce Like how expensive can the sauce be to be so stingy with thatA dinner for 2 costs around $60+ Bruh you can find better places to eat in Christiansburg Excellent food and worth every penny My favorite part of the meal was the beans best I\&#39;ve ever tasted Try the &#34;Caulizola&#34; sauce love it The wait staff had a few hiccups but this is reasonable for a college town with high turnover The owner\&#39;s wife was extremely genuine and even sat down to chat with us We\&#39;ll definitely be back soon! I haven\&#39;t eaten many steaks but this was easily the best steak I have ever had (Chuleta for those who are wondering) It was juicy and flavorful and not ridiculously expensive As for the sides I got pineapple and onions The pineapple was great but the onions were not as good Overall this is a great steakhouse and I highly recommend it Just don\&#39;t get the onions Decent steak place great for a treat Menu a bit confusing though that is the only thing id change I really loved the food I ordered the Pitaco a pita version of a taco with perfectly cooked and flavored sirloin (they also offer pork and chicken) with the optional brie The pita was crisped on the grill so it had crunch The flavor was awesome I ordered one and it was enough for me but a big guy would need 2 Service was good and attentive The atmosphere was nice relaxing and casual As others have noted it is expensive for what it is I\&#39;ve eaten here before and will come back but it is not a daily event Came in with 2 toddlers and a baby and they were so accommodating One of the waitresses even brought over paper and highlighters to distract the kids and they had plastic cups! The food was solid Sides were good meat was good sauces were good and the drinks were good (although strong) It\&#39;s on the expensive side - especially for Blacksburg - but sometimes expensive is worth it The decor/menu/ambiance feels a little cheaper than the prices might suggest but with little ones that\&#39;s maybe a plus Great visit perfect score across the board!In Blacksburg there are several good places to eat I visit a few times each year so I\&#39;ve tried several and find the only limitations are locations and atmosphere Gauchos is in a courtyard strip mall which could mean takeout joint with a few tables yet step inside and you get the complete opposite It\&#39;s well decorated and nicely detailed The service is very good relaxed happy servers will Shepard you through the small plate ordering process I\&#39;ve seen some yelp comments about the prices but I think they are fare keeping in mind you can get small plates of anything on the menu and try several items This is the way to go but the bill will add up however the food is really good so the value equals out I met Kiko the owner chef and he\&#39;s a terrific fellow He asked me how I was enjoying my meal as a good I asked for a kiss (exclaims it was terrific) he hugged me and kissed the top of my head that was funny and really a nice human exchange Just try this place and you will see for yourselves this is a gem Parking in the lot is ample and the place has a bar This place has it all FoodDude! I had very high expectations but unfortunately the food fell short The interior is nicely decorated and the staff are extremely kind and attentive However the food was disappointing We had gotten the Picanha Salad Ximango and Tapas Tour The food came out quickly and was good but there was something lacking that prevented me from giving a rating of 4 stars It may have been the style but the meat was under seasoned and a bit tough for being cooked to medium There were no Yucca fries either but the experience was nice Really: THE Best thing in Blacksburg Lived here for 20 years Seen places start strong and go out with a slow decline This place raises the bar for the whole town As long the two owners are running it it will become a long term establishment like The Cellar  It may be more expensive but you pay for quality and care Location - It is located in the strip mall across from Kroger behind the Starbucks The restaurant is not visible until you passed the Starbucks There were more parking spaces in the back We did not have any trouble finding a parking space on a Saturday night I did notice the strip mall and the parking area were pretty darkService - everyone was very friendly We had reservation and was seated on time Our waitress was really nice She found out we were there for the first time and went through the menu with us She made some recommendations and checked on us through out the meal The chef came out to check on the guests (probably because it was the end of the dinner hours) and he seemed really niceFood - The four dishes we ordered had nice presentation We all ordered steaks and they were good well seasoned and cooked to order I thought the steak were good cut but slightly more chewy than I expected based on the price point The yucca was crispy on the outside and really fluffy on the inside It was delicious I got guava sauce with my steak The sauce was slightly sweet and had a really nice guava flavor I used it as my salad dressing instead of a dipping sauce The sauteed vegetables (mushroom onion peppers) were VERY salty It was late and we did not bother to send it back to the kitchenPrice (minus 1 star) - This is definitely an expensive restaurant Steak (10 oz - 12 oz) meals were around $25 - $30 This is a good anniversary dinner date type of restaurant It\&#39;s casual but very cozy The food except the sauteed veggies and service were good Even with that I still thought the food was slightly too expensive This is not a typical Brazilian buffet place but much better! The service is fantastic and the food is outstanding We were not expecting having great food in this area and we\&#39;re pleased and stuffed with the awesome appetizers steak and chicken dishes Ask for what\&#39;s a must have here the helpful waiter can make your mouth water when he is describing them We have been three times and the last time way carry out All was great! Carry out took 20 mins (they text you when it\&#39;s ready!) Food is cooked perfectly it\&#39;s delicious and they give you plenty!! Service is great! I\&#39;ve been three times and see this place becoming a regular Love the authentic flavors I wish this place opened for lunch hours some days a week too No matter what you order it\&#39;s simply delicious The menu works best when you share dishes and try several items I\&#39;ll write a full review laterEverything I\&#39;ve ate here is amazing The steak is the best in town It\&#39;s all worth the pricetag Eat here Soft opening now!Gaucho is a new restaurant in Blacksburg but has been in town for a while now in other forms The owners had been regular vendors at the Blacksburg Farmers Market prepared food for local events and festivals and has products in several local independent grocery stores With that said Gaucho\&#39;s new restaurant is a huge step up from what I\&#39;ve seen them make before Which of course makes sense since they were only working with a single gas grill like you\&#39;d have at home Right now during their soft opening they are great variety of food options for you to try Everything we had was excellent I went with another person and we sat right at the grilling area where we were able to talk to the owner (Kiko) We tried out (shared) the signature steak a pork loin a cheese appetizer tapioca cubes potato salad and yucca It was well prepared with a great presentation I think my favorite was the pork loin but I\&#39;d be happy with any of it again Sometimes when I eat food that is from another culture I accept any \&#39;strangeness\&#39; as just part of the experience But all the variation from what I might get at a more common steak place was just plain delicious We didn\&#39;t get a chance to have dessert though but only because there wasn\&#39;t any room left in us! I\&#39;m definitely going back soon though The redesign of the space is great (it used to be a 5 Guys) and parking is easy The service is fast and friendly To go boxes are available and well used thanks to large servings I am not sure if it was pricey or not I\&#39;d say it was a good price for what we got which was a lot (2 appetizers 2 entrees and a beer came to about $50 with tax) So give it a shot! Great new Blacksburg restaurant with lots of good options for everyone Have been to other expensive Brazilian steakhouses where it is all you can eat and this is better! Create your own meal of your favorites without overeating or spending a fortune All food was amazing! Service pleasant and owners attentive and caring recommend as one of the best!!! This place is simply the best I have had since coming to Blacksburg in terms of food quality and friendly prompt service The Gaucho Bomb is out of this world good the steak is always cooked perfectly and the staff is very friendly and eager to make your dinning experience a great one!!!!! I always feel very happy and welcome when eating here which is more than I can say for most places I\&#39;ve tried in this area and for ME service is a very important aspect of dining out This place gets that!!!Keep up the great work!!!! This is the best restaurant in blacksburg by far From the moment you walk in to after you leave amazing environment The best meat appetizers sides you can buy!! If your looking for a good honest yet upscale restaurant Gaucho\&#39;s is the one for you!! Gaucho is like a shiny fragrant beacon in Blacksburg which can seem like a food desert at time replete with only so-so burgers and pizza So Gaucho how do I love thee? Let me (literally) count the ways: 1 Wonderfully savory seasoned meats grilled to perfection; 2 Fresh tasty vegetables to even the guilt about #1;3 Strong cachaa cocktails;4 Ever-expanding menu loaded with new favorites;5 Delightfully strange and addictive appetizers and desserts;6 Lovely green decor with Brazilian jazz soundtrack; and of course 7 Warm and committed staffI\&#39;ve tried something new at every visit and haven\&#39;t had a miss yet Nevertheless you can\&#39;t go wrong with the square meals If you\&#39;re on a budget the chicken is just as delicious as the beef Be adventurous! Try ordering out of your comfort zone! The chef (who is also the owner I think) makes some of the best food I\&#39;ve ever had in my life It\&#39;s clear that taste is of the upmost importance The atmosphere is great for a date You can even see the chef cooking all the food on the wood grill in the center of the restaurant Took our son and three of his friends for dinner on this past Friday night We made reservations online when we got to town and our table was waiting for us Based on others recommendations we all went for the square meal and we all loved it Would definitely go again (and treat our son and his friends this place is not college budget friendly) Given the quality of the food we thought it was a good value If you are a meat lover you will definitely love this place I am living in NYC and love to try all kinds of food I am confident to give a five star review and recommend it The smoke sausage is too good to miss and the steak is also amazing better than lots of steakhouses The restaurant has bar small tables and large tables so it is great for any events I have been to a number of Brazilian restaurants Gaucho\&#39;s is right up there at the top Although not the &#34;turn over a card glutton factory&#34; you get plenty of food What separates Goucho\&#39;s is their side dishes and deserts One of the few Brazilian places that you can actually go to and have small portions Great atmosphere and service Given what I\&#39;ve read on Yelp about this place my wife and I were so disappointed The food is really nothing special at all The pork chop I had was the toughest meat I think I\&#39;ve ever had Literally after finishing half of the portion I was given my jaws were fatigued I didn\&#39;t actually finish it--I brought half of it home with the hopes that my wife could salvage the meat and use it to make something edible My wife had the potato salad which was not very different from the stuff you can get from Sam\&#39;s club The beans that we both got were watery and overcooked The only decent thing was the fried tapioca but that wasn\&#39;t even anything special Overall if you are looking to blow $50-$70 on a meal you could do much better than this placebut perhaps not in Blacksburg Seems like in this town if you aren\&#39;t looking for pizza burgers or burritos you\&#39;re pretty much out of luck This is the real thing This is Brazil Best steak ever Order with the feijo and the flight of caipirinhas The best restaurant in Blacksburg VA The service is perfect and the food is amazing! I tried the food last year at the Blacksburg fresh market and never missed a Saturday You must visit this restaurant if you visit BlacksburgVA! Surprisingly the best meal I\&#39;ve had in the area fir a while Ribeye with sauted vidalias and peppers and chimichurri sauce was perfectly prepared and tasty The mate\&#39;s caipirinha was very good Flan was perfect Service excellent First thoughts on the food aloneWOW! Being a local chef in the town of Blacksburg I was blown away The authenticity of the cuisine was incredible All proteins were cooked perfectly And I will definitely being having date night here once a week! We ordered the appetizer trio which was exciting but I wish they weren\&#39;t out the yucca fries! But then we ordered the Gaucho Tour andincredible Seasoning was amazing Cook temps were perfect Atmosphere was awesome with the open grill Really excited to dine again! (First five star review by the way) Party of five tonight first time for me Three steaks two pork chops I had the pork chops and potato salad Very moist large portion of two thick chops very flavorful and tender one of the best I have ever had and the potato salad was a great side complement Everyone loved the food and three were regulars who indicated it is always excellent We had flan and banana/ice cream for dessert also very good There was absolutely nothing we had that could be criticized everything was extremely well done Very nice staff owner was very gracious and friendly We will be eating here every visit to Blacksburg too bad there isn\&#39;t a duplicate of this restaurant in our town Gaucho gets better and better! I\&#39;m from out of town and whenever I get the chance I stop by and never ever regret it Anything you order is amazing!!! Best restaurant in town!!! On a business trip my colleague and I were looking for a place to have a good meal and we discovered Gaucho\&#39;s The food was very tasty and the service was quick The menu was a bit unusual but we quickly were able to navigate to some excellent choices with the advice of our wait staff Lots of options and lots of choices I had the Agridoce dipping sauce Fantastic! I liked that they had a mini desert Just enough to have something sweet at the end of the meal without over filling me My colleague plans to tell his sons (VaTech alumni) to try to place the next time they are in town First time trying Brazilian food and it was amazing! We got the Tapioca\&#39;s Dice (with the spicy chipotle ketchup) and the Guacho Tour (with the chimichurri) - both were SOOO good I\&#39;d say my favorites were the chicken and the pork For dessert we tried their Brazilian fudge in coffee and fried banana with ice cream The fudge wasn\&#39;t our cup of tea but the banana was great Will definitely come back! :) Possibly the best for in Blacksburg The price is high compared to some other Blacksburg establishments but it\&#39;s still in the medium range (think $10 to $20 for an entree) The food is very high quality though: fresh delicious and made from scratch with high quality meats One would probably pay twice as much in a larger city I always get the salsichao sausage because I\&#39;m about eating pigs and it\&#39;s so good that I haven\&#39;t been able to try something else at the expense of eating the salsichao again I do the ala carte menu and have been able to try most of their sides The bean stew and fried bananas are along my favorites The Brazilian beer that they offer xango is excellent for people who love rich nutty dark beers Their flan is excellentThe staff are extremely friendly especially the owners who have been on-site every time I have eaten there The atmosphere is great for family a date or even a business meeting They also have an exceptionally well maintained restroomIf you haven\&#39;t had a chance to come here or if you\&#39;re looking to impress someone I would check this place out Great food and service I had no idea what to order but my waiter was very helpful and everything I tried was delicious! This is the best Brazilian steak house we have tried to date and as of tonight our go to special dinner place when visiting our son at VA Tech The waitstaff was extremely helpful and the food was amazing! We loved this place! Recommend ordering all kinds of entrees and sides and enjoying it family style We will be back! Very nice! Had a family dinner before leaving our oldest for his freshman year at VT Very nice dinner The only thing that was really missing was salt and pepper on the table Rude owner overcooked and we were told we were wrong in that medium is supposed to be red/pink in the middle Food was pricey and the house made sausage was OK not great This place is SO freggin good My husband and I came here with a few friends and had some amazing food and a great server Definitely our GO-TO place for steaks when visiting my baby at VA Tech! Well worth the price Steaks were perfectly cooked; and more importantly great quality You would not expect it to be much from the exterior but there is good grub at Gaucho\&#39;s My personal must haves when I go there are the fried Yucca and flan It is not often that I get dessert at restaurants but this is a must have for me We had heard good things but I have to say that the experience was even better than I had built it up in my mind The food was all fantastic! We tried the Dado de Tapioca and it was a very good GF option of a mozzarella ball We chose the typical Brazilian steak with onions and cheese fried yucca and chimichuri sauce Also we ordered the chicken and zucchini It was all delectable Perfectly seasoned and grilled! Ordered a drink off of their typical Brazilian drink list It was like a mint-less mojito and not too sweet The atmosphere is warm and inviting We kept our portion size choices small and paid $44 for a great meal for two I can see how you could end up spending more It\&#39;s all just so good! This restaurant is officially on my favorites list Just good clean delicious food Clever menu that lets you build your plate to your wallet\&#39;s restraints and your appetite\&#39;s desires It\&#39;s a husband and wife owner/operator situation and the service offered by both is exceptional The menu was explained thoroughly and the food prepared perfectly I had the chicken with salad and rice and beans and zucchini It was all great but the grilled zucchini was incredible If this restaurant were in my home town I would eat here once a week Best meal I had in Blacksburg Loved this restaurant! The food was flavorful &amp; delish I recommend the Trobador excellent combination Amazing food!!! I had the picanha square meal The meat was absolutely succulent and everything was cooked to perfection My friends all loved their dishes as well and we all left extremely happy! The owners are also very friendly! I highly recommend this place! Great flavor The veggies were almost better than the meat There is an a la Carte menu where you build your own meal or pick a perfectly paired dish Fresh Manns sausage was delicious and they recommend that you pair it with the draught Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale yum! Service was fantastic! The server took time to answer all of our questions and multiple people checked on us throughout the meal Well worth the price One of the best in Blacksburg The steak was incredible as was the passion fruit mousse Family of ten had dinner tonight Everyone was pleased with their meal Ribeye was cooked to order The zucchini was delicious and the cauliflower sauce was a favorite This has become my go to for dinners here in Blacksburg Great food great prices and you cannot go wrong with the plantains Oh goodness this was delicious! I searched on Yelp for a steakhouse and was not led astray! Ambiance was nice and casual Staff was very attentive and friendly eager to please And the food was amazing! I\&#39;m in town for work for the day and can\&#39;t wait to come back I\&#39;m eager to try new things but will continue to have my mouth water over what I had tonight which by the way was their signature steak cooked medium with cauliflower provolone sauce and grilled zucchini Yum! Go here for some killer churrascho The tapioca and yucca sticks were great Smoked Kielbasa was bomb! Just order the po de quejo ahead of time Friendly staff and service as well Outstanding best beef I ever had I strongly recommend I went with out great expectations and it surprises me big time! Most delicious food in Blacksburg! The Gaucho Bomb is an amazing combination of locally baked bread tender steak and creamy gorgonzola cauliflower sauceI could barely tear myself away to try a bite of my dining partners delicious beans and manns sausage Amazing! Service was very attentive and the chef owners were so welcoming We will be back often! Over pricedjust regular service and foodsSteak was good but pork loin was tough like a paper We absolutely LOVE this place!!! I highly recommend it We typically go with a few friends order several of the different meat cuts add in a few sides (definitely get the crostini and potato salad!!) then eat it all tapas style as a group Everything is delicious and everyone is super friendly :-) Definitely check it out! Great food but terrible service My friends and I decided to try this place out I was excited as they had a small menu and that generally is a good sign of a focused menu that highlights only the best dishes While the food was great the service was wildly offFirst I arrived earlier than my friends in order to grab a table It took about 10 minutes for a beer to be delivered to me ( there were also only about 4 other tables in the restaurant) They also got the drink order wrong They also got my friends drink order wrong as well But on to the mealThe food was actually great! I had 2 of the Beef and Bacon kebabs with a side of the potato patties The kebabs were great!! But the potato pattie was essentially a breakfast hashbrown which while it was good didn\&#39;t feel like Brazilian cuisine Also the dipping sauce was more of a dry rub Still very good but not expectedWhile the food was great the entrees leave much to be desired considering the price My entire meal was $22 and I left hungry as well as all my friends Charging $450 for about four bites of meat is ridiculous (entrees do -not- come with any sides unless you order a special)Finally our waiter switched two checks and charged my friend with my order and me his A simple mistake but shouldn\&#39;t happen I am a waiter myself I understand mistakes happen but charging people incorrectly is a big no-noI\&#39;m giving two stars for the following reasons:+great taste the meat was delicious- but very little food for the price- service was much to be desired especially considering how quiet and empty the restaurant wasI\&#39;ll come back someday give a second go It\&#39;s their first week so I understand people are still learning But I\&#39;d recommend adjusting prices because you\&#39;ll either leave hungry or leave spending much more than you intend to Came here for the second time Food was amazing Chicken was tender and all the veggies were perfectly grilled AMAZING Literally the best in Blacksburg Lovely atmosphere Quality food that\&#39;s outside the typical box Perfect portions Good price LOVE this place A little pricey but great for date night! Everything is excellent across the board plus they can make a mean caipirinha The service was absolutely horrible After getting our orders wrong pouring craft brews with 3&#34; of head not providing silverware until five minutes after food was served and not refilling waters at all the manager proceeded to have an attitude with us when we kindly asked if she could correct the dish To top it off the food was all over-grilled and over-priced And the bill was wrong We got a variety of the grilled meats along with some sides and all the sauces Everything was amazing The food is fantastic The service was friendly and helpful I just wish the ambiance was better The prices are above local average but it\&#39;s not a really a nice place for a special date I would still highly recommend if you want some really good food! Hands down the best food in Blacksburg I really don\&#39;t know what other people are talking about with their less-than-rave reviews It may take longer because they cook the food to order - right in front of you on an amazing grill I left so satisfied; I have not eaten like that in years My boyfriend had steak with steamed yucca - delicious and cooked to his preference I had the kielbasa and bean stew The beans were to die for We also had the friend tapioca appetizer which was a perfect light and fluffy starter It was a bit pricier than most places in town but it\&#39;s also much better food than other places My favorite restaurant in Blacksburg Amazing food great drinks but it can get a little busy Highly recommended! This is a beautiful little restaurant with a lot of potential It is right by the VT math empo and I think it\&#39;s a great place to take parents when they visit students The menu is a little confusing but it is very extensive and let\&#39;s you pick and choose your meal in an a la carte style There are also suggested combos which I found made the selection a lot easier The staff was very friendly and spent about 10 minutes giving us personal suggestions and favorites Food was amazing besides for the small portion sizes Prices were kinda high but it was worth it for the quality of food Service was excellent Nothing bad to really say about this place Finally a great place to eat in Blacksburg Everything was perfect We had the ribeye and picanha The drinks were awesome We had the flan for dessert and it was the best This is a great place for dinner or to meet friends for a quick drink and light appetizers The restaurant has a nice feel and energy about it This restaurant was first a regular vendor at Blacksburg Farmers Market Overall the food was very tasty and flavorful with every bite I enjoyed every bite of my dinner I tried the provolone appetizer and it was served on an unique platter It was something like a restaurant would serve their escargot dish I didn\&#39;t know what to expect from this appetizer but I was very happy with the dish The dinner dishes were excellent as well The meat was cooked properly and tasty I couldnt decide on which dessert to have so I shared all 3 with my dinner companion and they were all great I can\&#39;t wait to eat here again Really enjoy this place It\&#39;s inexpensive and caters to locals and VT students Alike Drinks are cheap! The best is to pick and choose different thing and share with friends The yuca and tapioca and chicken was fantastic Get the green sauce! It was my favorite The mushroom marinates and topped with cheese was a favorite too4 people with drinks cost us $50 which was very reasonable for Blacksburg We spent $200 at the black hen for a comparable mealThe food is different from what the rest of Blacksburg has to offer and the setting and decor is great Very laid back andComfortableI really am excited about this place Ignore the inconsistent college students who write factually incorrect things This place is cheap and great $4-$5 for a glass of wine? Yes please! And save room for the $2 chocolate dessert Very tasty!!I\&#39;ll be back gauchos! This is one of the most expensive restaurants in Blacksburg right up there with the Black Hen Portions are super tiny my kabobs only had a couple of ounces of meat on them They were a little overdone and not very satisfying to eat Service was pretty green but friendly I don\&#39;t know for how long a soft opening can go on but this certainly does not justify the terrible service and below average food For $35 per person you can wait over 2 hours after ordering to have your cocktail glass (caipirinha) filled just 2/3 of the way an overcooked steak and yuca For another $1 you can have a smear of chimichurri to go with that Who charges $1 for a few drops of sauce and gets away with it? C\&#39;mon Blacksburg you can do better Such delicious food I ordered the tri-tip and it was cooked perfectly on their wood fired grill Loved their beer selection as well Service was top-notch Both the food and the atmosphere are wonderful I highly recommend the chicken thigh but the steak with cauliflower garlic sauce is also excellent Another member of my party really appreciated the Pork chops The provelara is delicious and something new for Blacksburg The interior is simple but warm and the wait staff is quick as well as attentive The drink menu is not very large but they do have a few types of beer on tap and traditional Brazilian mixed drink choices The menu lay out is a little odd they offer prebuilt plates or you can build your own with great variations you can eat here several times and never have the same meal twice Over all the restaurant is great and a refreshing addition to Blacksburg Great food and service Sauces are very good with the beef or chicken You can order to your taste which was very cool but a little overwhelming My husband and I ordered menu items that were already figured out for us Maybe next time we will be more adventurous Staff was fantastic We changed the # of attendees on the reservation countless times yet each time we called w/ a change they were most accommodating despite the fact that we were going at likely its busiest time of year (Va Tech graduation) The food was fantastic the side dishes were amazing and our waitress in spite of how busy she was spent considerable time explaining to our group of Brazilian cuisine novices the menu choices and pairings w/ sauces etc It could NOT have been a better experience The first few times we visited this restaurant I would give the 5 stars In fact I couldn\&#39;t wait to go back Last night\&#39;s visit was abysmal! It took the very incompetent waiter 10 minutes to tell my husband the beer he ordered was out then another 20 minutes to get the beer he re- ordered only after I flagged him down- oops - he forgot!! How cute! My meal = terrible  Chicken thigh undercooked bean stew cold salad requested with NO DRESSING came with dressing which commenced to run all over my plate and flavored the rice Pretty much ate none of it Vege &#34; sandwich&#34; my husband had was basically a sad attempt at a vegetarian offering Portobello caps as a bun with some cheese and a hash brown MEH Oh yeah  the tapas appetizer was pretty good - except the sauce we ordered came out after we finished eating the hot food Must have been a VERY off night for them But we won\&#39;t waste another $62 to find out! The Brazilian stake house in the new river valley My steak was cooked to perfection The cocktail caipirinha was also fantastically dangerous 1 Food:Steak was well seasoned but slightly overcooked Pesto sauce was goodPork loin was over seasonedpotato salad was also over seasoned 2 Price:Way too expensive for Blacksburg3 Location: eh4 Atmosphere:clean restaurantreminds me of pizza joint in georgetown dc All in all I give them 25 stars out of five This is the best steak place in Blacksburg The steaks were grilled to perfection The menu is super robust and it could be easy to be steered away from the steaks Steaks are a must here! Service is pretty good The food is good-ish It\&#39;s not exceptional It is definitely over-priced though Service was good but the tables are tiny Ordered a medium rare ribeye but came out well and I don\&#39;t think it was worth sticker price it had on it Very slim choices on alcohol only 4 different beers Their signature sauces aren\&#39;t all that either there\&#39;s only one that is decent and I believe it\&#39;s just ketchup and Texas Pete mixed together I was seriously impressed with this restaurant The atmosphere was pleasant the waitstaff was both attentive and knowledgeable and the food was excellent The pricing was very reasonable considering the quantity and quality of the meal I was raised in a city known for its cuisine and I can easily say that Gaucho rivals the restaurants there and certainly surpasses most of what you can find in Blacksburg I will definitely be going back and bringing my friends and family! Excellent cuts of meat cooked very well Waitress was excellent Prices were good Not something you would expect to find in a college town but this place has good ambiance and one of the owners came to check on us Wonderful service and great food! Flavor what a concept This would be our go to place if we lived here Definitely will be back on next visit Thank you for a memorable meal! Great place for morning coffee Had the Mayan mocha not chocolate today hope it stays on the menu Cute little coffee shop! Love their coffee!!! I always get the latte and it is delicious! I was walking down N Main St following directions from my phone when I realized I had walked too far If you\&#39;re like me and ended up walking to the National Bank on the corner you missed the small sign a few stores ago so head back until you get to The UPS Store and turn down the alleyway They have two entrances and plenty of seating for being a small coffee shop I used the check in special for 25% off a hand made drink which includes almost anything except maybe the nitro coffee I ordered the 16oz Sweet Latte and it came out to $413 It\&#39;s the perfect blend of espresso and sweetness If I wasn\&#39;t from out of town I\&#39;d definitely come back It has a good vibe if you want to study or read a book Cute coffee shop and friendly staff! I had an iced mocha which was define (they use ganache as their mocha flavoring rather than a sugary syrup so good!) Their baked goods are homemade and outrageously delish If I were a student of VT I\&#39;d make this my go-to study spot! Love love love! The location of this shop Is perfect for the farmers market I ordered a vanilla latte and my husband ordered a drip coffee both of which were delicious The only funky thing about this shop is the area where you order It felt like we were hovering over people who were already seated But if you are looking for a good cup of coffee that is reasonably priced and delicious then go here I like it but I don\&#39;t love it The coffee is quality but I\&#39;ve had the pumpkin latte and a mocha latte and was less than impressed with both I also tried a jam bar and it was just ok the jam was more gummy in texture and did not taste fresh I\&#39;ve been trying to find a local coffee place since moving here from California and I feel that my standards may be set a little high I\&#39;ll probably come here again just not regularly This is a place that I\&#39;ll sincerely miss once I\&#39;ve left Blacksburg and I\&#39;m sad that it opened up in my later years here at Tech The location is rather small so there is seating but usually only single seats or two person tables I\&#39;ve been here before with a group of four and it definitely felt a little cramped but they try to make the most of their small space Their menu is small but very very good - every drink I\&#39;ve tried here has been wonderful Their cappuccino is one of the best and I had their iced sweet latte today and was pleased to see that it was handshaken and just sweet enough The baristas are friendly but can sometimes be a little slow as it\&#39;s usually manned by one person (or two at the most) The atmosphere is very calming and soothing so a little atypical from typical coffee shop bustle but with a steady stream of customers even late in the afternoon Overall I highly recommend checking Idego out and supporting its small business! As a plus it\&#39;s also right by the Farmers Market which you should check out too Nitro iced coffee YUM Looks like you\&#39;re drinking a Guinness at 8 in the morningJust like the good old days in college I stop here every time I\&#39;m in Blacksburg Amazing! I read a blog post about Idego having the best pumpkin spice latte in Blacksburg Needless to say it did not disappoint! Great atmosphere knowledgeable and kind employees and a phenomenal latte! Super nice service and good coffee What else can you ask for? Nicely situated right near the farmers market as well Great cup of coffee for a good price Love the vanilla lattes and the service is always great Coffee done to excellence A bit hard to find and the barrister was not very social otherwise a good up of coffee Excellent vanilla decaf latte but gave only 4 starts \&#39;cause of pricelarge size for $6 Chocolate chip plus something cookie was ok Parking seems interesting and the location seems hidden behind UPS from S Main street Still want to come back maybe once a while only for a coffee Great coffee fast service friendly staff Easy to miss it\&#39;s tucked away near the farmers market I\&#39;d definitely return Hands down the best coffee in the NRV There is not another coffee shop in Blacksburg Christiansburg or Radford that is as consistent as Idego The baristas are so enjoyable and remember you after you\&#39;ve come in a few times Wonderful environment plus they have a standing bar!! If you are looking for quality coffee there is not another shop that comes close Idego is it!! These guys know their coffee and espresso! Creamy smooth and perfect lattes that don\&#39;t need a bit of sugar or flavorlet the coffee do the talking here! Will definitely be back each time I\&#39;m back in town for a Hokie game! I can\&#39;t imagine any latte getting better in Blacksburg! Thanks for the sign on Main St to lead me to the door around the alley Cheers! Really quality coffee but the atmosphere could be improved The lighting is a bit too bright and makes the space seem unfinished If you are looking for a place to snack this isn\&#39;t your best option as they don\&#39;t have much food/snacks to choose from Great place overall if you\&#39;re going to study or have a quick yet high-quality coffee By far the best coffee I have had anywhere ever in my entire life of always I was so surprised to have experienced this little gift while in Blacksburg that I\&#39;m going to miss it Absolutely the best coffee in Blacksburg or really the whole New River Valley The quality can\&#39;t be beat and its a great alternative to big coffee chains especially if you\&#39;re looking for a really good latte without all the syrup and sugar The owner Paul works in the shop a lot and is very nice and knowledgeable about the coffee they sell They are currently working on opening their own roastery next door which will make it even better! While the coffee is delicious I usually don\&#39;t stick around to work or hang out; the atmosphere isn\&#39;t very cozy and there aren\&#39;t a lot of places to sit I\&#39;m picky about coffee Idego had ah-mazing espresso and a fantastic cappuccino! It\&#39;s on par with some of the best coffee/espresso I\&#39;ve had ever No place in Blacksburg compares and I\&#39;d argue they\&#39;re better than Lucie Monroe\&#39;s Also they bring pastries in from Bread Craft in Roanoke The almond biscotti is to die forI honestly wish I could keep this place hidden and uncrowded forever :( Open Sunday evening gave us the opportunity to enjoy Affagatos and Nintros Very good The Nitro system is three weeks old and the barista had a great time serving Ice cream for the affagsto was from a local dairy enabling an excellent desert High end glassware grinder espresso machine made for good savings Talented and informed Barista provided the very good service Six tables ten or so high seats enable computer work Fresh fruit and large cookies in the counter for the health nut or sweet tooth ApplePay closed the deal for us Great find tucked away just off Main Coffee was extremely flavorful and smooth super friendly staff (even for us wandering parents on orientation) and the entire shop is set up perfectly: no pastry case no excessive menu no distractions from that great cup Will be the first stop when back in town (oh yeah may stop by and see the kid in school too) Went here as per the suggestion of a local and a barista here (not partial at all) and I was so pleased with the place Idego is physically backstage to the Farmers market but steals the show as far as coffee and aesthetics go It has great tasting coffee (I recommend the mocha) is quiet and clean It\&#39;s not overpriced and also not cheap but there\&#39;s a reason you chose not to go to Starbucks this time :) I had a vanilla latte which was very good There were only a few pastries and not really a menu to speak of unless I was missing something Not much of an environment Love love LOVE the sweet latte The atmosphere is nice in the new Blacksburg location but could use some more furniture The people were great and loved how peaceful it was for conversation/studying Absolute best coffee in town That being said you get what you pay for Pricier than other coffee places but WORTH IT (if you care about your coffee and espresso quality) My only complaint is the size--I\&#39;ve often felt cramped in here wish there were more floor place Employees are always friendly and helpful Love this place because it\&#39;s clean and quiet for some great hacking! Small and cozy and hidden off the main strip Also great barista and great coffee Almond milk as a substitute Very impressed Clean bright place and a very friendly and helpful barista (Gary) who made perhaps the best iced mocha I\&#39;ve ever had Their selection of drinks on their menu is short but I\&#39;m of the impression that they can pretty much make up whatever you may desire and request I also like how clean the interior is which is a nice departure from the clutter you find in some coffeehouses Fresh coffee and pleasant atmosphere Nice customer service Terrific local coffee shop Highly recommend We were in town to visit some friends on the way to DC and were looking for a good local coffee shop The reviews caught my eye so we came here We simply ordered a &#34;good cup of coffee&#34; and we got a GREAT cup of coffee My husband is from Seattle so we consider ourselves coffee snobs--this little purveyor is totally on pointe Even as the coffee cooled (I\&#39;m a slow drinker) the flavors were delicious and complex I\&#39;m not kidding when I say that if you want to be wowed by a cup of brewed coffee come here You\&#39;ll forget how much you paid for it and feel supremely smug about supporting a local establishment that sources it\&#39;s beans from small domestic roasters Blacksburg is so lucky to have this place Paul cares about coffee and it shows The drinks are amazing by any standard The food comes from Roanoke and is decent If you are a coffee snob you won\&#39;t be disappointed No sickly sweet drizzling of caramel all over everything No weird milk/coffee ratios in lattes or cappuccinos If you just want a regular cup of coffee you also won\&#39;t be disappointed No one giving you a 2 hour lecture about the hillside where the beans were grown No one condescending to you because you don\&#39;t know whether you want the Ethiopian or the Mexican No one judging you for adding milk to your coffee or not knowing what a cortado is Awesome experience here! The barista was very friendly and seemed knowledgable I had a nitro iced coffee which was DELICIOUS Overall definitely a 10/10 experience There is nothing quite as welcome on a road trip as a reliably great cup of coffee We are pretty burnt out on the various Starbucks\&#39; across the country There was a time many many moons ago where their machines were properly maintained and their baristas were trained Now far more often than not we get undrinkable abominations of latteHave no fear! Idego has great beans and crafts some impeccable lattes Absolutely delicious The owner is nice engaging and speedySo worth going a couple miles off the interstate to swing by this place I\&#39;ll get this out of the way--there\&#39;s not a pastry case in sight at Idego Coffee This was weird to me at first but I got over it once I tasted the coffee I don\&#39;t know much about coffee but from what I do know this place is really serious about providing a high quality brewThe best thing is that the man behind the counter (I would bet he is the owner) is friendly and helpful Not friendly in a talk-your-ear-off kind of way but friendly in a way that he will answer any questions you have like a kind coffee guru I think I can actually learn a thing or two about coffee by coming hereOh and for those of you who are also in the lactose intolerant club fear not! Idego Coffee makes their own almond milk! This place is quite small And currently there aren\&#39;t many tables or open chairs But hoping that it\&#39;ll add more home-y feeling to it and add more furnitures like it did in Christiansburg! Their sweet latte isn\&#39;t your typical sweet latte! You can distinctively taste the espresso so it\&#39;s a bit strong but perfect amount of it if you\&#39;re a fan of quality espresso drink I\&#39;m a fan! Vanilla latte was delicious Very quiet laid back atmosphere A great place to get work done while enjoying a coffee Great little coffee shop in C\&#39;Burg They put out a great product wish there was one in Hawai\&#39;i Definitely better than the chains around town Barista was knowledgeable and very personable High quality coffee and tea And they are serious about how they prepare it Pricey but you definitely get what you pay for here Very cool environment &amp; good coffee selection Big plus that it\&#39;s quiet enough to also do some work This is a great gem! Best coffee in the NRV! The baristas are awesome and know everything there is to know about coffee! If you\&#39;re looking for top quality coffee this is the place! I had some stuff I needed to get done in Christiansburg so I thought I\&#39;d give this place a try I was impressed! The Wi-Fi worked well and every table had its own pair of outlets Furthermore it wasn\&#39;t crowded at all which was niceAs for the coffee itself I had a cappuccino which was good! The person I was with isn\&#39;t much of a coffee person but she ordered the mocha and thought it was delicious! I hate to say this because the barista and cashier are so friendly and the shop is adorable but the chai latte was disappointing It was too watery and lacked flavor I also purchased a flax seed raisin cookie that was tasty but they really do need more pastries Go Just go right nowShort version: Great coffee; great environment Great proprietor; Good internet speed (66/06)When choosing a coffee shop you want an owner who knows coffee who loves coffee and loves people You get that here and you get a fantastic cup along with itIf you like good coffee (If the words pour over and chemex mean something to you) then just go now If you just like regular coffee on the other hand just go nowThis place makes incredible coffee and Paul will talk shop as much or as little as you want Want to talk about the roast? The origin? The brew method? Nothing at all? Paul\&#39;s your manI had the Maker\&#39;s Reserve in a Chemex and it was wonderfulFYI: Internet speeds were (tested 3 times): 66M bps down / 06 Mbps upOh and the coffee is amazing but prices are super cheap! $250 for a Chemex? That\&#39;s nuts (Compare to a typical $4-$5) Great cappuccino Great service Great window seat Great music Great location The pattern in my cappuccino remainder until the bottom of the cup! By far this is the best coffee shop in Blacksburg (in the NRV really) Their coffee selection is excellent only using really well-sourced well-roasted beans Plus they know how to brew so that it brings out the different flavors Also just a nice calm place to hang out for a while Oh and they bring in pastries from Bread Craft in Roanoke - sooooo good I was invited to meet a friend at Idego today I walked in and there was a woman sitting at the bar and a baby in a car seat on the floor This was the wife &amp; child of the man behind the counter; who didn\&#39;t smile nor did he scowl He sort of waited for me to respond but to what I had not decided According to Wikipedia (hahah) Id references uncoordinated instinctual trends Ego references organized realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the super-ego The super-ego can stop one from doing things the id may want to do I was not sure if I was in his head or if he was in mine I quickly ordered a mocha I always start with a mocha and then on the second visit will try a cup of dark brew These two things tend to solidify my thoughts on knowing whether or not a coffee shop knows what they are doing The sign on the door said LaMarzocco A superb machine! The mocha was a gold standard No whip cream but rather a frothie milk so delicate it feels like silk on your lips; topped off with a beautiful heart My only regret is that I did not take a picture Don\&#39;t come expecting to eat; they have a small selection of muffins scones and cookies However if a perfectly made cup of coffee if your thing; I think the Id is worth the interaction because the Ego leads the mark on perfection Awaiting to hear the storyplease Idego do tellI will be back and would encourage you to go out of your way for a cup at Idego See what part of their story you can find out After seeing the great reviews I came in here to get an iced coffee - wherever the coffee is from - it is the best coffee I had in town! I hate to say but Bollos comes second for me! They have been open for about 6 months no doubt this place is going to thrive for years to come! Best espresso you can get anywhere in the Blacksburg Christiansburg area Closest real competition is sweet donkey in Roanoke Absolutely stunning prices for the quality of the drinks much lower cost than surrounding locations WiFi could be better and i find it too chilly at times but this is a great place of you\&#39;re looking for a friendly atmosphere Get to know the barista and regulars at the counter they are always up for a chat Definitely the best coffee in the area A close second is Lucie Monroe\&#39;s in Christiansburg This place deserves a 5/5 for the coffee alone and has a great vibe but the inside feels a tad sterile and could use some sprucing up They just recently relocated though so I suspect the atmosphere will improve with time It\&#39;s also close enough downtown to grab food at multiple places Parking is dumb - I recommend parking on the street somewhere or in a lot elsewhere and walking a bit to save some money Idego Coffee is unlike any other caf you could go to Paul is such an interesting and involved guy especially when he is making your coffee This place gives you the full experience They even offer coffee tastings every Friday evening! If you are looking for more an exprerience than speed or love that honetown feel don\&#39;t pass up Idego; and also be sure to try the caramel latte it\&#39;s incredible! Every thing about this place is amazing You can\&#39;t go wrong with anything you order They are priced very well for what you get too! The owner is a wonderful person as well Very cute little shop Visiting my mom and dropped by for a coffee great stuff Good to see places like this in the area Lovely art from locals adorns the walls (some for sale) Paul can help you key in on a drink you would enjoy while explaining why you do things specific ways to improve the process snd get the best possible drink Love the &#34;Sweet Tooth&#34; options I am not a coffee person so I enjoy having other items to choose from The hot chocolate is wonderful! Best I have ever had! Easily the best in Southwest Virginia Really a world-class coffee shop Great coffee and a very knowledgable staff The shop itself is small but has a sleek feel to it that is a refreshing alternative to the other coffee shops in town Best coffee out there!! Don\&#39;t waste money on anything else as they can\&#39;t come close and great customer service! You won\&#39;t be disappointed! great tasting coffeenice place nice coffeeyelp wants me add morenot much to addits coffeeits good Stopped by on our way down to NC We were both very pleased! My wife got a spicy chai latte that she loved I got a shot of espresso that packed quite a punch The muffin was clearly homemade and delicious! Now if only we were in Christiansburg more often Excellent coffee and espresso during a stop off I-81 Great service A welcome break from chain stores Deserves your support OH-MY-YUM!The food here is consistently NOMNOMONOM delicious Do yourself a favor and order {at least one order of} the fried dumplings Eat them there Do not get them to go I REPEAT - EAT THEM THERE! ;) They are at their optimal yumminess fresh from the fryer drizzled with their sauce Be sure to make good use of the Marco Luca Soy Sauce It really helps to round out the full flavor of this wonderful must-have dish I also really LOVE the Sesame Noodles The mix of the peanut sauce with the cucumber and nomnesses is just so tasty NOTE: These are cold noodles As are the Sweet &amp; Sour Spicy Noodles And they\&#39;re delicious for it Just don\&#39;t expect them to be warm Fried Dumplings - Fried Dumplings - Fried Dumplings What a wonderful hidden gem in an unassuming strip mall near VT campus And now that they\&#39;ve polished up the space a bit and gotten rid of the funky smell it\&#39;s even better! Fried Dumplings - Fried Dumplings - Fried Dumplings The staff is super kind and patient Willing to answer any questions you may have if you\&#39;re not sure about an item Fried Dumplings - Fried Dumplings - Fried Dumplings I\&#39;ve been MANY times over the last few years and I keep telling people about it so more and more people will know it\&#39;s there and it will stay! Fried Dumplings - Fried Dumplings - Fried Dumplings Did I mention the fried dumplings and sauce? NOMNOMNOM I may or may not have gone there and ordered two orders to make a meal of them {I really wanted 3 orders but contained my cravings} Essentially pan-asian street food Exactly what we came for The dumplings were as great as other reviewers lead you to believe! They grew on me even more as we ate themThe Sweet and Spicy cold noodles were alright There were some good flavor combinations in there but I think wife and I are hot noodle peopleThe guy taking our order was very nice and quick on getting things ready A second worker was really hard to understand when yelling out the orders but equally niceI\&#39;d love to see a slightly expanded menu By university mall there are a bunch of places especially the dreaded math emporium Now even though no one likes the math emporium there are a bunch of food options around there One of them being Marco &amp; LucaMarco &amp; Luca is located all the way on the left of the mall strip so a lot of people tend miss it They mainly serve dumplings and cold noodles but they also have other items such as the soup and steam buns I ordered dumplings sesame noodles a pork bun and hot and sour soup This place is relatively fair priced except for the dumplings They are relatively small and $4 for 6 For me though the dumplings are probably the best item on the menu They serve fried dumplings on top of a sauce that taste amazing The sesame noodles look pretty bland but they have a nice settle flavor to them Works perfectly with the dumpling sauce if you want to pour some of it on your noodles I am not a fan of the pork buns There is very little filling and they top it off with some type of sauce but you can\&#39;t really taste it As for the soup I was not a huge fan of it either The ingredients and color were different from the hot and sour soup that I am familiar with The soup also was hot from the temperature not really from the taste There was also a slight note of sourness but unless you were looking for it you probably wouldn\&#39;t have noticed Overall I probably wouldn\&#39;t come back because it\&#39;s a little too pricey for the amount of food I get However if you are ever looking for something light to eat in between meals I highly suggest the dumplings here The sauce for the dumplings is really good It\&#39;s a little hole in the wall place in university mall that you won\&#39;t be sorry you checked out It\&#39;s got great food for great prices There\&#39;s not much in the way of ambience and it\&#39;s a no frills kinda place but it\&#39;s good for a quick bite or takeout The people who work there are always friendly and the food comes out very quickly They don\&#39;t have a very extensive menu but what they do have is very good - especially the pan fried pork dumplings! The sauce that comes with it is sooo good Ordered the fried dumpling and sesame noodles (sorry I forgot the name ) The service was super fast and the man in charge was very polite The dumplings were juicy and perfect like usual And the noodles were a refreshing contrast Overall a great place to get a quick meal Prices are not worth the food you get Fried dumplings are about have the size expected with little flavor soaked in a sauce Pork bun is bland with weird glaze Why do these little dumplings taste like heaven?! Do yourself a favor and get two orders instead of one because you\&#39;re going to want to keep eating them! So cheap and so delicious! Try to eat them there because they do get soggy if you get them to go or wait till the next day to eat them (though I don\&#39;t know who would wait that long to eat them) The noodles and buns were average and I probably would just skip them and get another order of the dumplings instead Service is fast and the workers were kind Would definitely come back here! i\&#39;m in town from NoVa so i guess i am just used to a certain standard of asian food i brought my parents here (they are asian) and it was so disappointing that the meal was just uncomfortably silent as we quietly powered through our meal the dumplings are fine (probably best part of the meal) the buns are ok the sesame noodles we threw them away the food isadequate the man working there was very nice i guess i just don\&#39;t understand the high reviews for extremely average food UPDATE: After being told &#34;Shut up bitch!&#34; I spoke with the new management at Marco and Luca - Blacksburg location as well as the original Marco and Luca owners in Charlottesville The owners of Marco and Luca in Charlottesville told me the Blacksburg locations\&#39; management has been transitioned to Bill therefore they didn\&#39;t have much control over the employees However they were still interested in hearing me out and once they heard the story they apologized over and over again also displaying a bit of fiery anger for their children\&#39;s names being butchered (Marco and Luca are their children) When I talked to Bill same deal he was very apologetic and he\&#39;s in this massive management transition this very month (Oct 2018) so I\&#39;m sure a lot were out of his hands as well The point here is that the owners/managers are aware of such guy working and representing their business and they all seemed to be pretty furious Bill gave me the word that he will replace this employee as soon as possible I hope he\&#39;s a man of his word Not just for my sake but for the character and integrity of their business Paul and I ate at Marco &amp; Luca for the first time today Service was speedy and friendly I was impressed by the young man who was running the counter cooking and serving food The best part of our experience was the sweet sesame noodles Paul ordered They were absolutely delightful The hot and sour soup was good but it was missing the sour component which made it hot soup (temperature and spiciness) If you like to feel the burn and/or want your sinuses opened up give this soup a tryOn a less positive note the dumplings which so many reviewers rave about are essentially flavorless Neither the dough nor the filling have any oomph Besides the dismal dumplings the restaurant serves all their food in styrofoam and paper containers which is a sin in my opinion The seats are terribly uncomfortable--hard and ricketyNext time I will order the noodles and soup and opt for takeout Came here at 7:20 on a Saturday night Walked up with a couple who had called ahead their order to find people inside eating and working but all locked doors We tried to get the attention of the guy behind the counter after double checking the sign on the neon door saying open and the posted hours claiming they were open until 8:30 He ignored us and when another patron asked him if she could open it for us he had her sign to us that it was closed The other couple had already paid for their order If they\&#39;re this bad up front I don\&#39;t want to try the food Excellent quick light meal at a good price I had the sesame noodles and an order of dumplings and will return soon The dumplings here are great! A must have if you stop by I also get their sweet and sour noodles which are yummy The only thing I miss ALMOST as much as college is this place When they opened my Sophmore year I was apprehensive Dumplings? I can make these at home can\&#39;t I? Well not like this The sauce they serve them with is exactlty the perfect mixture of sweet and salty The dumplings are great quality and even when they are busy the food is served quickly The cold noodles werent my favorite but I always loved their egg drop soup I haven\&#39;t been in years but the food was great for a solid 3 years Was looking for dinner and Marco &amp; Luca showed up on my yelp search It says on yelp that this restaurant is open until 9 but I got there at 8 and they were locking the doors and closing down for the night I didn\&#39;t catch his name but this very nice man let me in and made me dumplings even though they were closing down shop The dumplings were absolutely delicious and the soy sauce and sweet chili sauce were a great touch I will definitely be coming back the next time I\&#39;m craving dumplings! (: THE dumpling place Nothing more impressive than this one guy making killer food for a whole line of people This is a small place with a small menu that is apparently a popular spot for VA Tech students It was the weekend and school was out so the place was totally quiet I got the sweet &amp; sour &amp; spicy noodles and some fried dumplings The noodles are served cold but the fusion of flavors of sliced apples cilantro green onions and that sweet and spicy sauce was a great mix If you\&#39;re looking for something different that you haven\&#39;t had anywhere else this place is quick and easyand cheap Hands down best dumplings I\&#39;ve ever had! This quirky little place has a corner location in an outdoor strip mall It has a really inviting atmosphere and in nicer weather there are even several outdoor tables around the side Order/pay at the counter and they\&#39;ll let you know when your order is ready When I was visiting there was only one employee working He took about six orders at a time and then prepared them all at once That\&#39;s a logical way to do it since he didn\&#39;t have any help and if he made them in batches they were prepped faster He was really friendly even thanking me for stopping by and saying goodbye when I left I had taken a tiny table near the window and I read a book there for about an hour and I didn\&#39;t get frowned on for spending a longer time at a table than necessary for eating I was very impressed by both the dumplings and the cold noodles I tried Excellent food at really reasonable prices! Highly recommended! Can\&#39;t get enough if this place Honestly just go I usually order the dumplings and the spicy noodles and they are a fantastic combination I literally live this place and love going here It\&#39;s good food that is cheap and SUPER FAST service I always recommend this to friends! Try it! The food was good but the service was terrible When I went there they took an exceptionally long time to bring me my food while forgetting about the people before us and completely forgot about my partner\&#39;s which took two minutes to make as it turned outGreat food terrible service Holy moly I really REALLY want to come here every single day if I had the money to do soThis is only for the dumplings I really disliked the sesame noodles because they\&#39;re literally what they sound like I dunno if people like it but if it\&#39;s on the menu I guess people look for it so that\&#39;s fairThe dumplings kind of remind me of the dumplings in NOVA in general I had some really good ones in the Korean restaurants They really strike me with as \&#39;home food\&#39; for me personally so this place really gives me that nostalgic vibe My friends and I love suggesting this place it\&#39;s just so good - wish this place was 24/7 honestly The dumplings are terrific However you cannot count on them to be open during their own posted hours They close on a whim and often don\&#39;t even open at all This happens at locations both in Blacksburg and Charlottesville Extremely disappointing! I went here TWICE within a day Came to VT to visit my friends and because I heard such great things about this place I made sure to stop by! My first visit I got two orders of the friend dumplings and goodness gracious it was delicious! For only about $7 you get 14 mini dumplings that will make your mouth water The signature sauce is unforgettable! The second time I visited (a few hours later) I got the dumplings and tried the cucumber cold noodles To me it was very ordinary nothing special about those noodles but my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy itIf you go to VT or in the area make sure to stop by for some yum dumplings!! This place is awesome for those who eat pork The cold apple noodles are awesome but man those dumplings smell so much better! A very great option but not for people who don\&#39;t eat pork or meat in general This is a great little placeI love the fact that they have such a small menu I see a lot of reviews here mention it like it\&#39;s a bad thing but I dig it I\&#39;d much rather go to a place with a just few great choices than to a place with a long list of mediocre options It simplifies thingsThe first thing I tried was the cold noodles with peanut sauce because my GF brought some home for me to try It was very delicious; reminiscent of the cold noodles I had in Tokyo and the peanut sauces I\&#39;ve had in various Thai places Again I see a lot of other reviews here complaining about the noodles being cold but cold noodle dishes are not uncommon in the East Yes they did kind of seem like spaghetti noodles but they were fantastic nonethelessBecause the noodles were so good we went back a couple of days later and tried a few more thingsThe dumplings were truly incredible I wouldn\&#39;t say there were the best dumplings that I have ever eaten (I\&#39;ve had a LOT of dumplings in my life) but they were definitely amazing Furthermore the sauce they are served with is really wonderfulWe also tried the pork buns Again awesome Spongy and filled with porky goodness Plus they are served with that same delicious sauceHonestly this place is so good I would continue to go there even if they only one item on the menu  and it wouldn\&#39;t matter which one! I would drive up there just for the noodles I would drive up there just for the dumplings And I would drive up there just for the pork buns The fact that they have all three just means I have three times as many reasons to go! With such a small menu you know that their heart and soul must go into each dish - and it shows! Delicious steamed buns and crispy dumplings and the cold sesame peanut noodles are so refreshing on a warm day Prompt service with fresh dumplings dropped in the pan as you order them An excellent spot to hit right after spending some time at the Math Empo A real Blacksburg treasure Very simple very delicious!Dumplings are always crispy and packed full of flavor especially coupled with the Marco Luca Soy SauceSesame and Sweet and Sour Spicy noodles are a good sized serving and never fail to satisfyTry the Hot and Sour Soup when you have a chance it\&#39;s very cheap and very yummy! Good not amazing but hella cheap! There is something to be said for finding quick chow on a college campus A place with a very limited menu can pan out one of two ways One be a hole in the wall and serve a menu one can count on one hand because they\&#39;ve perfected all of it OR two be a hole in the wall out of choice with so-so dishes taking advantage of circumstanceI think this place is maybe more the second AND perhaps journeying toward the first I wanted to &#34;literally&#34; (think Chris from Parks and Rec) stumble into an awesome dumpling shop hidden from everyone but the privy and gustatory collegiate elite at VT but did notThe place has a great wall of soda in front of their counter The service is quick and stern Atmosphere inside takes advantage of whatever business was there before and adds some Chinese (??) decor like painted scrawls wooden gates and oversized red paper lanternsThe dumplings are on the smaller side come fried and swimming in the special house sauce I like for the dumpling to be a little more bready but these were pretty good The steamed pork bun wasn\&#39;t as fluffy as I\&#39;m used to but still pretty good Sweet and sour soup had seaweed tofu egg drop in it I didn\&#39;t care too much for it The cold noodles in sesame and peanut sauce were nice Sauce was a little sweet and noodle serving very generousOverall I docked the stars because the atmosphere was lacking and the dishes offered though inexpensive were not incredible Given that the atmosphere doesn\&#39;t give me a reason to hang out and 4/4 items I ordered were just ok I don\&#39;t have much reason to come back Marco &amp; Luca is the type of place that focuses on what they know best offering a limited menu of dumplings buns or noodles Their dumplings are some of my favorite always crispy and flavorful and served with a sauce that\&#39;s reminiscent of thick slightly sweet hoisin sauce and hot chili oil Their noodles served cold always hit the spot packing that same perfectly balanced sweet and heat taste that the dumpling sauce has The only issue I\&#39;ve ever had was that once I was served a bun that was still cold inside; I assume they buy those or make them ahead and freeze them but either way it just needed to be steamed a little longer Without a doubt when I am visiting Blacksburg and craving Asian food I had straight to Marco &amp; Luca The dumplings are heavenly as is the sauce Not much else going on but good for a quick stop or light dinner! Very solid place for dumplings The food here is simple tasty and at very reasonable price I usually pair my dumplings with sesame noodle As a Hokie you\&#39;re deprived of &#34;Asian&#34; food on campus Venturing off campus to find Asian food spots may take you to a gem like Marco &amp; Luca Known for their cheap and tasty dumplings Marco &amp; Luca never fails to satisfy my craving They have a very small menu but each item is crafted to perfectionOther than the dumplings my personal favorites would be the sesame noodles w/ peanut sauce and their hot &amp; sour soup The sesame noodles are cold and refreshing which is a different but pleasurable take on conventional noodles The hot &amp; sour soup provides a remedy for all sicknesses tooAs I look back at my time at Virginia Tech Marco &amp; Luca has been one of top go-to food options I highly recommend you come here even if you\&#39;re not craving dumplings It\&#39;s a nice small snack while you\&#39;re studying at the Math Empo and a great option if you\&#39;re adventurous and want to try something new One day I hope to meet Marco &amp; Luca so I can tell them how much I love their food I enjoy their pasta dishes especially the cold sesame noodles I just get bummed when I go in and everyone\&#39;s getting dumplings but there are no vegetarian dumplings If dumplings are what they\&#39;re known for couldn\&#39;t they consider offering a vegetarian option? Great place to eat--I\&#39;ve eaten here dozens of times Soup is very good dumplings are very good and the sesame noodles are very good Super delicious dumplings in a savory sauce Came through Blacksburg on our way out east The drive off of interstate 81 is well worth the detour The place did not have many people in it and I was surprised as the food was out of this world Lovely porky bun a little pricey for two fifty for one but tasty none the less Highly recommend this place The dumplings were fantastic and inexpensive! They are fried and come in the most amazing sauce What I liked best was the employees--very friendly and quick After reading the reviews I thought I should try the fare at this restaurant I\&#39;ve never had steamed pork bun and was excited to try it Have to say I was disappointed in how tough it was Very unexpected Not much meat inside as well The dumplings were tasty and I\&#39;d go back again for those when the craving hits me Indian music Italian name Chinese food KindaI didn\&#39;t realize it at the time but this is a dumpling house and not a Chinese food restaurant I came in on a cold day wanting some nice hot food and saw that the menu options were limited Dumplings Steamed buns Soup Cold noodles They appear to have a limited kitchen capability The cold noodles were true to their name in temperature but very flavorful The hot and sour soup was a little bit peppery for my taste The steamed bun tasted very good I\&#39;ll have to come in again to try to dumplings since that\&#39;s their specialty A small eatery famous for its fried dumplings Besides that it serves cold noodles steam buns soups and fountain drinks that\&#39;s all The fried dumplings are different from potstickers as they are completely fried to form a crispy yet a little hard shell I would prefer potstickers with only the bottom deep fried The apple pieces makes the cold noodle bowl unique I\&#39;ve never seen people do that before and I think to put apple pieces is a brilliant idea: apple\&#39;s sweet taste neutralize the hot flavor from the noodle source Hot and sour soup is similar as other Chinese restaurants but is spicier Will come and try the buns next time Marco &amp; Lucaoh how I\&#39;ve missed you guys During undergrad you guys were my best friends I saw you guys so often that you even thanked me with extra dumplings all the time! You guys are the best most Hokies would agree and if you\&#39;re a new Hokie reading this to determine whether or not you must try this place then let me tell youYOU MUST Cheap Satisfying Filling What more could you ask for?! The dumplings are fried to perfection and the cold noodles are delicious Both sesame or sweet &amp; sour are great option but I personally prefer the sweet &amp; sour a little bit more For $350 you get 7 dumplings and $4 for noodles You also have the option of choosing pork buns as well Don\&#39;t expect gourmet dumplings but for a money conscious college student this is a great place to grab food for less than $10 Depending on the time of day or the time of year this place can get pretty busy or just the complete opposite Regardless the service is always friendly and fast Have I convinced you yet?! If not just give this place a shot and determine for yourself! :) Incredible dumplings pork buns and sweet and sour cold noodles!! This is a must try!! It\&#39;s also very cheap! My husband and I bought some pork dumplings and hot and sour soup to go When I tried their food I was so impress because the taste was so delicious I recommend this place to other people who love to eat dumplings and hot and sour soup They have reasonable prices This place Writing this review makes me want to get in my car drive to Blacksburg and order dumplings The dumplings are fried fresh and come served in a delicious tangy sauce Everything else is good too but next time I\&#39;ll just order dumplings and a Coke and leave happy as a clam disappointed because their hours lied went on saturday and they weren\&#39;t even open like they said they were Delicious dumplings! Definitely the best in the area by far The sauce that comes with it is some of the best sauce I\&#39;ve ever had My only tiny complaint about it is I feel it\&#39;s just a bit on the more expensive side That might be because I eat dumplings regularly anyways If you hvaen\&#39;t tried this place though you must! It\&#39;s part of the VT experience I have been CRAVING fried dumplings ever since I moved to Blacksburg Lemme tell you THIS PLACE IS SOOOO GOOD!! The price is good and the food is DELICIOUS! I had to get the fried dumplings twice the day I visited Highly recommend this :) Cold noodles hot dumplings I\&#39;m game! Not sure what type of Asian food it is but it\&#39;s tasty! I\&#39;d come back The name sounds Italian but it\&#39;s definitely Asian The dumplings are really good sometimes could be served a bit hotter!  The hot and sour soup is the best I have ever had in my life Prices are very reasonable Soup is spicy w/ the perfect balance of everything  This is my goto soup when i have a cold or allergies very restorative Not many choice from the menu Steam bun is not really steamed but microwaved Service is good Cold sesame noodles is their best option to choose from Dumplings are okay Not a good fit when you are super hungry and cant wait for wait Oh my gosh YUM!! If you haven\&#39;t eaten here then you\&#39;re missing out!! The menu is small which means you can easily try one of everything! (Which is what I did and will never regret it!) Usually a solid bet they have great dumplings and noodles When we came in on a January ight before classes started the open sign was on and the hours started they were open for two more hours We ordered some dumplings peanut noodles and soup No soup they didn\&#39;t make any We asked for cups for water and the guy told us they were closing and we couldn\&#39;t eat there No explanation of why we couldn\&#39;t have water just that they were closing now One person who came in after us was served but then with the open sign still glowing others were turned awayI totally understand and sympathize with businesses changing their schedule to coincide with the University break but it seems rude to arbitrarily do it on the flyMaybe the food was tainted by our precipitation of the servers attitude but everything tasted off (Also have the peanut noodles always been spaghetti??)I\&#39;ll go again but another night like that would be my last A small location with a limited menu The dumplings were good but a bit on the greasy side Maybe I would have had better luck if I didn\&#39;t arrive right before closing The service was sweet and quick I was in and out in less than 10 minutes I am willing to return and try something else on their menuRecommended! It pains me to say it but it just might be possible that some of the best dumplings I\&#39;ve ever tasted were in Blacksburg of all places at least for the price ($350) They were really outstanding and were paired with some sort of soy sauce but calling it soy sauce would slander how delicious the sauce really is YumI also tried the Sweet &amp; Sour Spicy Noodles which come with apple soy sauce hot sauce cilantro green onions and sesame seeds The noodles come cold so they feel more like a salad but are worth trying Unique and flavorfulIf I had less regard for my health I would just go for two well three orders of the fried dumplings Great dumplings for super cheap! Cheap and delicious! I had the dumplings and the sesame noodles and both were very good and filling all for about $8 Nice decor and great workers would highly recommend eating here!! The dumplings were good but everything else was mediocre at best The hot and sour soup tasted like egg drop soup with extra ground black pepper The steamed buns had very little filling in them The cold noodles were overly sweet for me I stop here ever time I am in town Everything here is delicious and reasonably priced Wish we had one of these in or near Marlton NJ I admit the dumplings are very good but that\&#39;s it There is no selection and the noodles are cold The two flavors they have on the noodles they have are good but if you want something more go somewhere else Best dumplings I have EVER had and I love dumplings We went by there just as he had locked the door to close but he let us in before he closed up And I am so glad he did the dumplings were crispy fried and in the most amazing soy sauce I will definitely make this a routine stop whenever I visit Tech Love this place so much! Bring all my friends here and they all end up loving it The sesame noodles and dumplings are delicious the workers are so nice and are always a friendly welcoming face :) Will miss this place when I graduate All I can say is that it\&#39;s 10 am in DC and I am seriously trying to figure out when my next trip to Blacksburg is because these dumplings are AMAZING And you can\&#39;t beat the prices! My fiance and I used to drive from Blacksburg to Charlottesville just for these famous dumplings Of course now that we\&#39;ve left Blacksburg for good this place comes and plants itself right in the Math Empo strip mallAnyway we were visiting Tech this weekend and stopped in two days in a row It\&#39;s just as delicious as we remember it Of course we got the dumplings We both got double orders because you can\&#39;t possibly just have one The dumplings were cooked perfectly and the sauce the sauce is just the best I don\&#39;t know what they put in it but it\&#39;s amazing Also for $3 an order there\&#39;s no excuse not to eat theseI also got their sesame noodles in peanut sauce This was a cold noodle dish that\&#39;s kind of like a salad and that too was very good The sauce made the dish Though these noodles were great I think the best item on their menu are the dumplings so the next time I go I\&#39;ll prob double up on those again Actually the next time I go I\&#39;ll probably call ahead and buy 100 frozen ones and a big cup of sauce and just take them home with me Real talk though you guys just go eat here and order a million dumplings you won\&#39;t regret it Wish there were warm noodles cold just isn\&#39;t my taste I guess Also I thought the sauces were too sweet Otherwise this place is a great spot for a quick and simple meal on a student budget Dumplings are great and I love their dipping sauce However with such a limited menu it\&#39;s not worth my time to go Not sure how this is such a popular chain Amazing food for great prices Fast and friendly service too! Definitely recommend to anyone in the Blacksburg area One day I was taking the bus from the empo home when I noticed a new sign where the Quizno\&#39;s used to be - what the hell was Marco &amp; Luca? I quickly googled it on my phone and then became determined to try it out asap Alas! I was not the first one to get a review in on Yelp but I am here to leave a review Marco &amp; Luca are famous for their dumplings in Charlottesville and rightfully so Thank goodness they opened up a location in Blacksburg! And for 6 dumplings for the price of $3 it\&#39;s definitely not a bad deal - in fact it\&#39;s a great one! They\&#39;re smaller more ball-shaped dumplings but they are pretty filling and do come with the Marco &amp; Luca special soy sauce Besides being really flavorful and tasty they\&#39;re also nicely crunchy The first time I ordered these I had to stop myself from getting up to get another order even though I felt full Along with my sampling of dumplings I also got the steamed bun (pork) and the hot &amp; sour soup Personally I didn\&#39;t like the steamed bun all that much - the dough for it felt a little thick (a little like the thick traditional pancakes you eat with Peking duck if you\&#39;re Asian savvy) and it wasn\&#39;t as fluffy or as full of meat as it could have been As another review mentioned maybe if the price was a little lower (it\&#39;s $2 a bun) On the other hand for only $150 the hot &amp; sour soup definitely delivered - it was extremely flavorful and warmed me right up! They\&#39;re not skimpy on the tofu or seaweed in the soup as well which really adds to the flavor Other things on the menu include two cold noodle dishes and a veggie steamed bun but I\&#39;ll have to save that for a followup I\&#39;ve heard good things about the noodles and also spotted a few people eating it while I was there! All in all you can\&#39;t go wrong with the dumplings - they\&#39;re delicious Though with the prices it\&#39;s easy enough to eat through Marco &amp; Luca\&#39;s entire menu I\&#39;ll definitely be coming here more often! Basic cheap $9 for dumplings pork bun and soup I liked the soup more than the food items to be honest The sauce on the food was plentiful so much so that it leaked from the crappy take out containers I was given about 25 napkins so somewhere a tree is crying Would love to give it a 5 star review because we were excited to try everything after reading other reviews BUT Walked in at 8ready to order at 8:05NOTE Clock said 8:10 He wanted to know eat in or carry out We said eat in He was quick to tell us that they close at 8:30and obviously didn\&#39;t care to have our business So we walked out Good luck with any success with that attitude! Completely awesome dumplings soup and cold noodles Visited multiple times and will continue to do so Chinese buns Dumplings Coke It\&#39;s simple and you can\&#39;t really get it anywhere else around here That makes it damn good when you\&#39;re craving dumplings Those were some solid Dumplings!  Just a tad crispy nice thicker Soy sauce Very good  The Hot and Sour cold noodles were very good as well and the Hot and Sour Soup was unique and delicious  Might have to eat here again before I head back to Cincy!I am not a fan of the &#34;to go&#34; styrofoam containers Come On! Get with the 2010s and Go Green!  Compost Friendly Paper Container would be much cooler!!!!! The perfect local spot Has a very friendly atmosphere and cheap prices $350 for a TON of dumplings that are incredible I will definitely be back to try the other few menu items but for the price and quality Marco &amp; Luca cannot be beat Giving it 5 stars because the fried dumplings and hot &amp; sour soup are some of the best I\&#39;ve ever had I wasn\&#39;t a huge fan of the cold noodles but I think that was more of a personal preference I like my food hot The steamed bun is different and worth a try but get some dumplings and soup and you\&#39;ll be very very happy Super cheap too A great lunch spot! I just wish they had some kinda of hot noodle dish like a veggie lo mein to go with the dumplings Great food that is ready very fast I had:Fried dumplings - you get 6 and they were perfectly crispySweet and sour spicy noodle - dish is served cold but is goodPort hot bun - comes out really really hot but is satisfying and filling My husband and I have been going to Marco and Luca since we were dating (we\&#39;re young but that\&#39;s still about 4 or 5 years) We used to go to the one in Charlottesville so we were elated to find out there was one in Blacksburg (We even got our engagement pictures taken in the one back home)Marco and Luca\&#39;s is great it\&#39;s good food it\&#39;s inexpensive and they\&#39;re always friendly Walked in and saw a very very small menu and got a little concerned but don\&#39;t let that alter your decision Easily the best fried dumplings I\&#39;ve ever had and their Marco Luca soy sauce is amazing Definitely coming here again The menu is pretty limited but what they have is done pretty well It\&#39;s also worth it for the amount you pay For under $20 we got two serves of dumplings two buns a thing of noodles and a soup and that was enough to adequately feed two people without being super stuffed The buns were okay but not great They came with sauce on the bottom which made the bread a bit soggy Noodles were good (we got the spicy ones with apple) and even though they\&#39;re cold noodles the spicy sauce was a good belly-warmer The dumplings were tasty--I\&#39;d probably just get these and the noodles next time and forgo the buns No way I was expecting such a great experience from a place that looks like this does Simple menu perfectly executed The cold noodles are spiced in such a way that the flavor becomes more complex as the meal continues Dumplings are perfectly crisp while not being dry Very nice Get the dumplings and a pork bun and you\&#39;ll be a happy soul Tried this place yesterday after driving by numerous times I didn\&#39;t know what they served only that they had a dumplings sign in the windowNeedless to say i walked in and saw that their menu consisted of dumplings cold noodles pork or vegetable bun and hot and sour soup Not a huge fan of hot and sour soup in general nor cold noodles and since the sign in the window said dumplings I thought i would get an orderAnd wowthat saucethe dumplingsdelicious! Although one order is not quite enough for a solid meal i think you need to order two orders of 6I will definitely be going again for their delicious dumplings! Despite a very limited menu the food they have is great especially the dumplings they\&#39;re known for which are served with a sweet soy sauce But it\&#39;s mainly dumplings noodles and pork buns here A more extensive menu would be nice but certainly they know what they\&#39;re doing nonetheless Good location near campus too Awesome dumplings &amp; the cold noodles were very unique The flavor was immense &amp; the prices are ridiculous Two soups two drinks two noodle dishes &amp; an order of 8 dumplings $1900 YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING AWESOME SPOT! Simply amazing dumplings You get 5 or 6 but they are really filling and enough to leave you satisfied The best part about Marco and Luca\&#39;s is how inexpensive it is The only downside to this place is that they have very few menu options They are so good at dumplings I wonder what other delicious cuisine they could whip up But it seems to be working so more power to them! When my boyfriend told me he knew where to get delicious dumplings I thought he was nuts I swore I wouldn\&#39;t like them because I\&#39;m a very picky eater However one bite changed my mind completely I crave these like no other I typically get 2 orders each time I go because I haven\&#39;t gotten brave enough to try some other thingsI have had a bite of my boyfriend\&#39;s sesame noodles but I was not a fan because they tasted too much like peanut butter for my taste I\&#39;m excited to try the sweet and spicy noodles though! Wonderful place and now I\&#39;m craving dumplings again so I guess I know where I\&#39;m eating lunch tomorrow! Great food! Can\&#39;t beat it for the price and friendly service Although I just started reviewing this is the place that I would reviewed beginning Came here to try the dumplings had to order 2 more and the sweet &amp; sour soup which was surprisingly delicious (I didn\&#39;t think I\&#39;d like the tofu) Great food for a great price! I\&#39;ve come here several times and their menu is consistently good I always get the dumplings because they are filling flavorful and a great deal Also there aren\&#39;t any other places in town with fresh dumplings soThe dumplings are fried so they have a crunchy exterior The oil makes it more difficult to overload them with sauce but I usually manage Speaking of which they have a unique sweet slightly spicy soy-ish sauce that they put with their dumplings and buns which is rather tasty although I wish it was a bit more spicy to balance out the sweetness I\&#39;ve had both the veggie bun and the pork bun I find the cabbage flavor to be a hair strong in the veggie bun but it\&#39;s filled with cabbage so that is to be expected The pork bun is filled with tender pulled barbecue pork that makes me weep tears of gold Seriously it is that good I\&#39;ve gotten their peanut sauce noodles and they were good but not my favorite of their offerings They are cold not room temperature Maybe I will try again in he summer The hot and sour soup seems to be a bit unpopular on here but I adore it It has big pieces of soft (but not silken) tofu and egg in it as well as seaweed and scallions and a strong flavor of black pepper It is piping hot when served and so even though it is not extremely spicy it can clear you out by the time you reach the bottom of the container which has to be about three to four cups in volume-extremely generous for the 250 priceThat\&#39;s the other thing about Marco and Luca\&#39;s you can eat a lot for less than ten dollars I usually get a soup and dumplings and pay about seven after taxes I could not recommend a place more fervently The price point of this place is really the main attraction The food itself is a hit or miss depending on what you order Overall it\&#39;s okay I recommend it for a quick bite and if you\&#39;re up for something new Very good soup and pork buns! 9 bucks with a drink! Went there while traveling based in the reviews and they don\&#39;t lie very good simple food Pretty much the best dumplings ever My daily lunch spot basically Its super cheap (Used to be cheaper though they shadow raise the price twice a couple years back but it\&#39;s still a great deal) You pretty much can\&#39;t go wrong with anything on that menu my favorite is the dumpling and soup combo Pretty much the perfect lunchor snack I\&#39;ll miss this place when I leave Blacksburg I wandered into this place and wasn\&#39;t entirely sure what to expect I was surprised by the friendly service and by how quickly my food was ready I ordered dumplings and steamed pork buns and I really enjoyed both The prices were pretty cheap and I spent less than nine dollars on dumplings pork buns and a drink I\&#39;m a little used to Chinese food practices where they stuff a ton of food into each order but even though the serving sizes were a little smaller than expected they were still pretty filling The dumplings were fried and soaked in their house sauce which tastes almost like soy sauce and complements the dumplings The steamed pork buns were very fluffy and the pork inside was really good Overall the food was nothing to write home about but I still liked it and I\&#39;ll definitely go back to try some other things on the menu Their dumplings are amazing worth the slightly longer walk from mall entrance to their place They fry up frozen dumplings for you and serve them with their \&#39;specialty\&#39; sauce It\&#39;s pretty good but not phenomenal You can purchase similar dumplings from any Asian markets for much cheaper price This shop is certainly better than overpriced mediocre Panera So if you are tempted to go to Panera for a quick lunch just go here and you\&#39;ll be more pleased This place is quite good compared to many other Chinese places that I\&#39;ve been to The service is always quick The dumplings and soup are the best I\&#39;ve ever had I\&#39;ve tried not to go here too often but the food is so good! The dumplings here tastes funny to me especially the source too sweet and too much soy sauce for a dipping source The portion is pretty small to me This review is for the Downtown Roanoke location I give this place 2-Stars because the owner of Marco &amp; Luca lit up a cigarette while we were eating outside the patio! Really Mr Owner The dumplings are usually pretty good I\&#39;ve been here a couple of times and noticed that there is no consistency in cooking the dumplings I will only eat here again if there is nothing else to eat around the area I absolutely love Marco&amp;Luca Their dumplings are delicious I suppose I\&#39;ve never had dumplings before so it could be partly that but I find them absolutely amazing Omg the dumplings the speed and the price I dream about the dumplings and I\&#39;m not a fan of Chinese food at all If you\&#39;re reading this you\&#39;re most likely interested in eating some dumplings And on the real this place will satisfy the craving Extremely affordable and damn that sauce on them dumplings make me believe each one was made out of love This place is amazing I think I ate here once a week once I had discovered this place I graduated in May and I haven\&#39;t found anything as good! The dumplings are perfect and the sauce they do with it is delicious My personal favorite is the sweet and sour spicy cold noodles yum!! They only have 10 things on the menu but I\&#39;d go with the noodles dumplings or soup - steamed buns aren\&#39;t stuffed with much Great dumplings! Their spicy and sour soup is really good! Noodles are good too!!! I just don\&#39;t like bunsNot too much choices but good for a simple delicious meal I\&#39;ve tried and failed to find better dumplings in and around Blacksburg and it\&#39;s just not possible Why? Because these are quite simply the best dumplings I\&#39;ve ever had Anywhere The rest of the menu is top notch as wellbut those dumplings are other-worldly The fried dumplings are good The cold noodles are more suitable for summer and the sauce was on the sweet side But I feel I was overcharged $1949 for a small box of dumplings 2 cold noodles $8 and one veggie bun $15 So he charged me $10 for the dumplings?? Ridiculous! I don\&#39;t know how I never noticed this place It was amazing Very good very fast and they have a few other food options if you aren\&#39;t in the mood for fried food Simple menu but really good stuff Dumplings are delicious; as good as I\&#39;ve ever had The noodles likewise are first rate The steamed buns are OK I\&#39;m getting hungry thinking about the place Best Dumplings EverAlso in my experience they never just give you 6 :)I\&#39;ve tried their noodles and pork bun as well Noodles are cold (meant to be)I think I prefer my Chinese noodles but still good flavors! And the pork bun was also good but a little extra breading but I liked that because the breading was quite deliciousLastly SO cheap! Can\&#39;t beat those prices for a delicious meal! Been coming here for the past four months just for their soup and dumplings It\&#39;s cheap and when you craved dumplings and don\&#39;t want to make it--come here Should warned that their dumplings can get very oily Asked for extra napkins to squeeze the oil out I\&#39;ve tried their soup with soft tofu sliced wood fungus mushrooms and scallions on top for $2 The soup is a hit or missed sometime it\&#39;s so salty and starchy I just eat the tofu and dumped the rest The dumplings and cold noodles are yummy Buns are so-so (outside/bottom is a bit chewy at times) but fine when I\&#39;m feeling like having that sort of thing and I\&#39;m just personally not a fan of hot and sour type soups All in all this is a great place to get a quick bite that isn\&#39;t fast food and definitely one of the better restaurants I\&#39;ve visited in Blacksburg Fried dumplings are recommended Cold noodles do not have meat but they also taste good I drove 4 hours from Richmond to Virginia Tech to take my daughter to try out for the dance team I wouldn\&#39;t have thought a town like Blacksburg would have anything interesting to eat When I found this place from Yelp I had to stop by to see what was all the hype about the dumplings I can honestly say that is was very good! I wish it was a little bit more crunchy but overall it was quite delicious with the sweet soy sauce I will definitely stop by again and try the other dishes on the menu After finding out about this place less than a week ago I\&#39;ve been here three times This should give you an indication of how amazing their dumplings areSeriously get the dumplings It\&#39;s an order of six but they give you one extra I haven\&#39;t had the noodles yet (because how can I walk in and not get dumplings?) and the pork bun was decent but I wouldn\&#39;t recommend it (Especially in light of the dumplings)The soup though The soup was absolutely fantastic (This is my first review on yelp because I just had to write one for this I may have a problem But luckily at these prices I don\&#39;t mind :3) Went back to Blacksburg to relive my college years this past weekend On the drive down my friend mentioned that Marco &amp; Luca of Charlottesville opened up right here in Hokie territory! We had planned to eat lunch there for Sunday and I could not wait all weekend I ordered the hot &amp; sour soup the sweet spicy noodles and dumplingsMy whole order only cost ~ $8! My friends were\&#39;t big fans but I LOVED the soup! It was a combination of egg drop hot &amp; sour miso and seaweed It was piping hot and perfect after a day of drinking The noodles were sweet and tangy The apples really brought out the sweetness of the sauce I liked it so much that I got another order to go! And nowthe dumplings! The dumplings were a great deal $3 for 6 (they give you an extra one so 7) I\&#39;m sad that they didn\&#39;t open up when I was a student there! I got 2 orders of these for my brother in Northern VAOverall awesome food for an affordable price That\&#39;s a winner in my book I\&#39;m definitely coming back the next time I visit Blacksburg I could always go to Charlottesville but I don\&#39;t think they really like us Hokies over there ;) The Dumplings are very good and inexpensive The staff are friendly It\&#39;s nice to get one of these here in Blacksburg Give it a try It was amazing!I had the pork bun and the sesame noodlesThe sauce in the noodles was divine and tasted very goodThe hubby and the kids had the small fried wontonspork and a vegetable bunThe cashier at Oasis recommended this place and we will be back Just as good as the original in good old Charlottesville! Those crispy dumplings with that amazing sauce AND you can pay by credit card? A+ for me! I can\&#39;t remember what was in the dumpling but he microwaved it Tough as shoe leather Never again The cold noodle were a required taste I first had these dumplings when I went to Charlottesville on my way back to Blacksburg I would say these really do live up to how good people say they are For the price I think it\&#39;s a good deal how much they give you However I did not like the cold noodles I ordered they were tasteless and there was not enough sauce If you are looking for a place for quick lunch or dinner this is it! Let me just say the dumplings were amazing The soy sauce that they served them with was a nice sweet and savory It was a good thing that we ordered 2 servings! The two noodle dishes we got were tasty but couldn\&#39;t hold a candle to the dumplings I would go back just for the dumplings Although slightly more expensive than it\&#39;s Charlottesville counterparts (I think it\&#39;s due to Blacksburg tax laws) it\&#39;s just as simple and delicious A filling satisfying lunch of warm dumplings with a sweet (not so spicy) sauce and cold noodles makes it my favorite goto spot in Blacksburg This place has great food and a truly amazing story:Dumplings for Virginia (&#34;Der Spiegel&#34; 02/2007)There are stories which are true and there are stories which are beautiful This one here is almost too beautiful to be true but it isDragana was born in 1967 in Doboj a city in the North of Bosnia Her Dad was a catholic her Mom greek-orthodox She went to school in Banja Luka and went on to study agriculture then education and psychology at Sarajevo University When the civil war started and Yugoslavia started to fall apart she thought &#34;this cannot be true I cannot live like this&#34;; and left via Hungary and Austria to Augsburg Germany where one of her aunts was living After two months Dragana was recognized as a refugee of war With her aunt\&#39;s help she found a job in a Chinese restaurant on Theaterstrasse &#34;The usual: washing dishes in the kitchen I was glad that I was able to work and that I could send my parents a little bit of money&#34;Sun Da from Beijing China was working in the same kitchen A chef by profession he legally entered Germany late in the year 1990 &#34;I had never seen a Chinese man before It was love at first sight&#34; But Sun Da was &#34;a little shy&#34; He accompanied Dragana to the tram stop every night after work and one day she just took him in her arms and kissed him They married in 1994 and one and a half years later their first son Marco was born&#34;We would have loved to stay in Germany&#34; Dragana who learned German during her time in Augsburg remembers &#34;We tried everything we could but it was impossible&#34; She completed an apprenticeship as a nurse with Malteser Hilfsdienst but was not able to get a work permit afterwards Thus she went to work as a maid at a hotel and had a cleaning job on the side When after the Dayton agreement Yugoslavian refugees were supposed to be &#34;repatriated&#34; Dragana and her husband filed - with the help of Caritas - for immigration in the US &#34;We received approval at the end of January 1999 and left Germany mid March&#34; From Augsburg via Frankfurt and New York to Charlottesville VA where distant relatives of Sun Da were livingFour weeks after their arrival Dragana was already working at the restaurant of the Omni Hotel She cleared dishes from the tables A year later she had become an Assitant Manager &#34;I was proud of this achievement They gave me a chance&#34; Her husband renovated apartments during the day and cooked at the Omni at night In May 2001 their second son Luca was bornSun Da had always wanted to be self-employed One day they came across a tiny store on Second Street A door and a window with 60 square feet attached They celebrated the &#34;Grand Opening&#34; in December 2001 Dragana and her husband were standing on the inside and on the outside people were lining up to buy dumplings fresh from the pan for $3 per serving &#34;Something like this hadn\&#39;t existed in Charlottesville before it worked out great&#34;Dragana and Sun Da were working back to back He did the cooking she was selling dumplings at the window &#34;It was tough We neither had air con in the summer nor heating in the winter&#34; After two years they moved into a proper store with a kitchen air conditioning tables and chairs on Main Street The menu stayed the same however: two types of dumplings two types of cold noodles one soup In March of 2004 their third son Nicola was born&#34;The city was very good to us Everyone helped us And we felt at home from the very first day on&#34; The International Rescue Committee a private organization which helps refugees took care of the rent for their apartment for the first three months &#34;Medicare&#34; provided health insurance for the first eight months Local volunteers donated furniture clothes and toys for the kids - &#34;everything we needed in the beginning but couldn\&#39;t afford&#34; And older lady Camille Price helped the young family with administrative paperworkToday Dragana Sun Da and their three sons live in their own house that they bought for $300000 The bank gave them good conditions for the financing &#34;In Germany we wouldn\&#39;t even have been able to get a loan to buy a car&#34; Marco and Luca go to a school for gifted kids In the summer Dragana and Sun Da want to refurbish their small restaurant and re-open it as an &#34;Organic Juice Bar&#34; They have been living in Virginia for eight years now but haven\&#39;t seen a whole lot of their new home country &#34;We went to Virginia Beach twice for a two day beach vacation&#34; Nevertheless they appear to be happy They became American citizens a year ago Dragana from Doboj her husband Sun Da from Beijing and their son Marco from Augsburg The two American born sons were citizens right away hey want to extend the restaurant and travel to Beijing in the fall to visit Sun Da\&#39;s relatives And who knows maybe there will be the possibility for a joint business venture with a Chinese partner in China &#34;That\&#39;s our Plan B&#34; says Dragana and puts on a Chinese smile I\&#39;ve been 3 times in the last two weeks I\&#39;ve only had the dumplings they are so good I haven\&#39;t felt the urge to try anything else Really wonderful food I\&#39;m so glad they decided to come to our area The dumplings are good and the sauce they come with is incredible I\&#39;ve also had the cold noodles and think they are a good choice as well I\&#39;m not a fan of the buns though A little thick/soggy/not quite enough filling Really they just don\&#39;t compare to the dumplings which are only about $3 a serving Get two orders and something else to make a meal of it They raised their prices on everything with the explanation that the cost of doing business in Blacksburg is more than Charlottesville ??? $250 foe a steamed bun you can by a dozen for that amount at an Asian is absurd To top it off I saw the cook microwave the frozen bun in the back It stuck to the paper plate and was chewy The dumplings are good but not exceptional People say this place is cheap but $350 for 7 small dumplings is high in my estimation The secret sauce is good but it is just Horsain and soy sauce mixed together The soup here is incredible At $2 a bowl I find myself stopping in and getting it all the time As others have said it seems to be a mix of hot and sour and egg drop with a few other tasty things thrown in I haven\&#39;t tried the dumplings since I don\&#39;t eat pork but the veggie bun was not so great and only had a few small shreds of cabbage in it The noodle dishes are also forgettable but that soup the dumplings are delicious! fried to perfection and the sauce is amazing one order is not enoughjust sayin\&#39; :) YES YES YES!!I can not drive past this place It is so good! All of the Tibetan dishes are traditionally flavored well made and worthy of an experience I would highly recommend that you stop by and order a bowl of Thenduk (its a meal) and a side of Momo\&#39;s Not all food is ethnically Tibetan but their curry is delicious! Go ahead grab that home-made Lassi from the fridge Happy Eating! In Blacksburg when I was a freshman one day I noticed a shop called Himalayan curry cafe and went in because I never had Himalayan style curry before and wanted to give it a try Now being a senior I still go to this place because it is pretty good! A lot of my friends and I absolutely love their sweet and spicy pork curry The taste of it is pretty good and when it covers the rice its amazing Going to Himalayan curry they also have this unique hot sauce and a sweet soy sauce Adding these two sauces to your curry (or anything really at this shop) makes the dish that much more amazing for me Out of all their menu options my top 5 dishes here are the sweet and spicy pork curry chicken biryani vegetable curry fried rice and their samosa\&#39;s Beside getting their pork curry sometimes I like to get their biryani which is a flavorful rice dish A nice addition is also their samosas which come with a green sauceOverall Himalayan curry cafe has really good food and a wide selection so there is something for everyone A staple when I visit Blacksburg The curry is a unique taste and is a large portion for the price that you pay It is served over rice and you get it when you orderThey also have a house made hot sauce that pairs nicely with the chicken that you have to ask for when you pay I usually ask for less sauce since the sauce is pretty runny This way the rice isn\&#39;t soaked in the same sauce as the chicken is Chicken for the curry chicken is white meat!It\&#39;s not the best curry ive ever had by any means but for the area it is a good value and it is a comforting meal One of the only Nepalese restaurant in Blacksburg the food was mediocre but it is filling for the price A lot of Asians come here just to have the famous chicken biriyani The employees are very kind and deserves a tip The music around the cafe is wholesome and gives a chill vibe I would recommended this restaurant for people who want good asian food! My nepali boyfriend and I went here for dinner and went back for lunch We ordered spicy chicken curry and chung king chili Overall the place is really nice and my boyfriend said that the decoration is pretty authentic The food is good and the curry is not so strong (both taste and smell) We also ordered chili chicken and he said that you could find the same taste in Nepal The momos however was ordinary--nothing special This is a great place Very nice people at the counter They weren\&#39;t super-busy but had a fairly steady stream of customers The Samosas are gargantuan and they taste great without the sauce Their green sauce put it at the next levelThe Biryani was very flavorful and the perfect amount of spicy Our lips and gums were tingling Do watch our for the bones though -they leave them in for this recipe The chicken was awesomely tender thoughToday we were making a run to several places for dinner but that curry looked extremely tempting too If we every make it back through Blacksburg this will be a required stop The Chicken curry and Beef curry is amazing every time as well as the lentil soup! A good place to go for a home cooked meal feel Food was very bland Chicken curry had no taste They dump so much of rice and curry and lost my appetite the minute I saw that Not many choice on the menu One of my co-workers frequently recommends this place Tonight I finally made it over thereThe dumplings were goodThe spicy chicken curry was goodThe butter chicken was goodService was friendlyThe tables were cleanThe prices were fantasticNo complaints uhhhhhhhhhh please see attached my photo of the &#34;butter chicken&#34; i ordered what is this? what did they serve me? it was  okay my mom had some and was like &#34;why does it taste like nothing?&#34; my sister got the chicken curry and that had slightly more flavor overall i am just confused i\&#39;m sorry this was just disappointing I could be really skeptical when it comes to an exotic cuisine When I had it at first it was alright and then it really grew on me and now I come here too often They give you a lot of food for the priceFOOD: (5/5)*Authenticity: the food here is not strictly from a certain country but a fusion of Tibetan Chinese and Indian food Trust me it\&#39;s a good combination*Menu:- Curry: they have different types of curry My favorite is the Spicy Chicken curry They give you small sample cups if you want to try The curry goes really with their signature Himalayan sauce (the orange sauce) The cilantro topping adds good freshness to the rich curry sauce They do half and half for the curry also (for example: half chicken half vegetable curry)- Fried rice: the fried rice is dry (which is a good thing for fried rice) and flavorful I love it - Samosas: I love their homemade samosas The samosa comes with the green sauce I like it better with the Himalayan sauce- Momos (steamed dumplings): It\&#39;s similar to Chinese dumplings but with some Tibetan twist The momos come with the chili paste sauce It\&#39;s even better if you ask them to add some soy sauce to the chili paste- Chili and Chung King: Chinese style stir fried meat (chicken or pork) with some peppers It\&#39;s not as flavorful as it looks I\&#39;m not a fan but people seem to like it- Lassi: don\&#39;t miss the homemade yogurt Grab one from the fridge when it\&#39;s available!SERVICE: (5/5)It\&#39;s a local and family-owned business Everyone is really friendly here ATMOSPHERE: (4/5)I\&#39;m not a fan of their interior design but I can let it go because the food is really good here This is honest food and it\&#39;s a good value And if I\&#39;m honest I\&#39;m a little disappointed with the curries which were the feature items judging by their prominence on the menu The chicken curry was fine and ready-on-order The vegetable curry however needed time to prepare and was a bit undercooked when it came out Cauliflower can be undercooked but potatoes no There are a few other menu items you could try like the soups and the dumplings I actually like this place I only had a limited try of their menu to date but what I tasted was great (momos lentil soup and somosas) Staff is very friendly Just a fun place to eat inexpensively (from plastic plates etc)  but so be it Hidden gem!I always felt like Himalayan was a lowkey place to eat at and I hope this review gives them the more exposure! Himalayan probably offers the best curry in town no doubt For the low prices and the portions that they give you it\&#39;s definitely a bargain and you\&#39;ll leave with full stomachs for sure I personally like the beef or chicken curry What\&#39;s also unique is that they have bingsu (although I\&#39;ve never tried it I hear it\&#39;s good)Himalayan is a great place to go to even if you don\&#39;t have a craving for curry It\&#39;s a solid choice for anyone who\&#39;s hungry and doesn\&#39;t want to spend a lot of money All I can say is I\&#39;m sorry Blacksburg if this is a representation of a well reviewed restaurant hostess encouraged me to order curry over momos because &#34;curry is quick&#34; So I did and man the beef in it was so low quality and it was basically $8 for white rice and beef stew with half of it cartilage I had a samosa too and it was ok but had obviously been cooked a while ago and just kept warm as the outside was super limp Food like this makes me sad inside Everything about this place Blacksburg needs places like this Just reiterating my undying love for himalayan I now always get half lentil soup half veggie The ingredients are all listed which as someone who has food allergies and is vegetarian is amazing The Lentil soup has an excellent flavor You can get half meat half veggie if you so desire! Don\&#39;t forget the sauce Everything is made with love here Hwy 55 is next door and I will never eat there If anyone chooses that business over this one they are making a huge mistake They\&#39;re expanding their menu and incorporating Bingsoo -- I love it The owner is one of the most kind people you will ever meet in your entire life His story is on google Eating here supports his family and journey What a sweet little find near Virginia Tech I have no clue why anyone would say this food lacks flavor I got the Pork sweet and spicy curry and it was great Not a lot of sweet but a nice little kick at the end For the price you can\&#39;t beat this place I\&#39;ll definitely be back! This is one of those places I frequent when I\&#39;m craving comfort food without the hassles of cooking and cleaning up I\&#39;m really glad they added the chicken fried rice and the chilli chicken to their menu They\&#39;re deliciously spicy with ample amounts of heat yet entirely flavorful I\&#39;m a huge fan of their lentil soup as well The food is usually made to order and so sometimes there may be instances of over cooked meat or excess salt but the owner is really nice and always replaces the food if I tell him the problem with it Discovered this gem shortly after moving here Everything I have tried is delicious: Curry Biryani Lentils Menu is small which makes ordering easy they top meal with fresh cilatro (or not depending on preference) and most of the menu selections are plated to order allowing for short wait times First time in Blacksburg and I was hungry Was recommended to come here by a friend and I am super glad I did I had the chicken curry served with lots of cilantro and the dumplings The curry wasn\&#39;t thick like Japanese curry and it was served with Jasmine rice? idk forgive my ignorance but it was long grain rice I liked the consistency of the curry and the generous portion given The staff was very nice and the food quality made me feel like I was eating a home-cooked meal The sauces on the tables were really good too There is a mild soy-sauce one and a spicy/sweet sauce that brings out a lot of flavor They also seem to serve Bingsoo here but I did not try it This is great Curry is fine If you don\&#39;t like one kind of meat there is variety I liked the pork But definitely try the momos they are great! Excellent food Excellent service What more needs to be said??As a student at Virginia Tech I have made Himalayan curry a part of my regular diet and it never gets old The pork sweet spicy curry is my personal favorite If you have a bad idea about curry I implore you to break out of your comfort zone You won\&#39;t regret it! Average at best Wasn\&#39;t sure what the expect but was a bit more optimistic based on yelp rating Had the pork sweet chili curry and chicken dumpling to go All curry is sitting in in warming pans and the rice in the cooker Had to wait for the chicken dumplings and well they were bland and very thick dough The pork was unidentifiable and most pieces were dry and hard Curry was fine but no real depth of flavor just chili Portions were better than average for price Service was good Probably won\&#39;t be going here again next time I\&#39;m in town I\&#39;m new in town and the smell drew me in The staff were incredibly nice and before I knew it they were giving samples of everything I got the spicy chicken and sweet and sour pork curries They were not too hot but they did warn me up a little Both were delicious I\&#39;m definitely coming back I\&#39;ve stopped in a few times this past month The food is not that tasty The prices are low but add more flavor and charge more The curry was very bland the veggie samosas fell apart--also bland The only prize was the lentil soup The restaurant is trying to please the Chinese crowds by adding several Pho beef chicken The last time the waitress was rude--not the thing to be with me since I\&#39;m the paying customer I had already paid so ignored Previously used to have dumplings with less filling but now it\&#39;s sufficient I love the dumplings here The biriyani here is good Rice and pork/chicken is also good I personally prefer pork+rice/ chicken momo Both of them are favorites If you are looking for cheap food with decent taste Himalayan Curry is perfect It\&#39;s a modest place to eat but worth the money you are paying Also the curry rice option as well as biriyani comes with spicy and non-spicy When they say &#34;spicy&#34; it\&#39;s not as spicy as I am used to eating but it\&#39;s better than the non-spicy which taste sweet I got to try their bingsoo which seems to be their specialty Large proportions of flavorful curry! Definitely a place to hit up in Blacksburg if you are tired of the same old same old down town or looking for some good reasonably priced eastern foodThe staff has always been very pleasant and the store always clean! Food was very bland all around We had the vegetable curry the butter chicken and a samosa I didn\&#39;t bother finishing my meal None of it was impressive and we definitely won\&#39;t be back Maybe they are just having a bad day? One of our favorite places to eat when we are in Blacksburg! I love the vegetarian curry! I am never disappointed except when they are out of Kheer! The owner and staff are so gracious My brother and I were pretty hungry for dinner so he chose this place since you get served immediately! The portions were giant We both got the beef curry plates and the flavor was really good! However the beef was pretty tough And there was so much of it I didn\&#39;t really even want to finish it There\&#39;s a lot of space in the restaurant so we hung out for near an hour The people working there were very friendly! I love the curry here The pork curry is my personal favorite and the hot sauce they have on the tables is delicious The portions are very generous and the prices are extremely reasonable; I have a difficult time finishing a $7 plate of their curry The only con I have for this place is the parking can occasionally be awful during dinner time due to the students I want to like this place because it\&#39;s a Nepali restaurant in Blacksburg but the food is just so mediocre Nothing I have ordered here the 3 times I\&#39;ve come can disabuse me of its meh-ness At this price point I\&#39;d rather get dumplings from Marco and Luca or fast food The food here was delicious I would recommend the chicken curry chicken momo\&#39;s and the lentil soup Getting cilantro on any of these 3 dishes is a must I also tried the beef curry and the beef momo\&#39;s the beef wasn\&#39;t that great compared to the chicken I really liked the fact that the rice and curry was available instantly The momo\&#39;s took about 10min to get the wait was worth it I would recommend all sauces as well they were quite tasty and delicious Nice and spicy very delicious This curry reinvigorates my life and soul It lights a passion in my stomach and my heart I shed a tear for every day that I do not indulge in this sacred feast I would definitely recommend this deliciousness to anyone who has never laid curry on their delicate tongues because this is something that will fill that void in your life I have been graced to have eaten the chicken and pork curries both fantasticall in all:A LOT OF GOOD FOOD FOR NOT A LOT OF MONEY This has become one of our favorite go-to restaurants in Blacksburg Food is priced well and tastes GREAT! Butter chicken was really good and the samosas and green chutney excellent The new Thenthuk soup is to die for! If you like ramen or Asian noodle soups I highly recommend! They keep adding great stuff to the menu keep it up! Very solid and cheap food! I ordered the Sweet and Spicy Pork Curry and it was quite tasty The portion size was very good and filling especially for the price If you are someone who has a smaller appetitite you will have plenty left over too (luckily they give it to you in a to-go box) My brother ordered the Chicken Curry and it was only okay (which is why I am giving this place 4 stars rather than 5) I feel like this place can definitely be hit or miss depending on what you order so if you don\&#39;t like a certain item I wouldn\&#39;t write off the restaurant right away We also ordered the Classic PatBingsoo for dessert and that was great as well I have never had BingSoo before but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it If you aren\&#39;t aware BingSoo is a dessert with sweet red beans a sweet malt-like powder mochi and bran flakes strewn throughout a big bowl of shaved ice We split a bowl ($5) and it was plenty for the both of us Would recommend if you are in the market for inexpensive ethnic food! Love this place!!!! Big portion for its cheap price! The curry doesn\&#39;t smell too! The workers are really friendly and full of smiles whenever I visit! Pretty disappointing Curry=flavorful and I had to salt mine It was hot (temperature-wise) so it had that going for it I was just expecting more Some of the best curry around for great prices Cannot recommend enough If you go there be sure to try the sauces the put out on the curry Absolutely delicious Overall: 4 starsAbove average curry with good portions for a fair price I come here regularly and know what to expect except for the inconsistent meat portions However I would recommend Himalayan Curry Cafe to whoever likes curry as I believe it\&#39;s one of the best in the area Food Quality: 4 stars Typically order the Sweet and Spicy Pork Curry which I think is the best option It has good flavor/taste and the portion size is very fair as I am typically pretty full afterwards The menu is very simple as it basically is a decision between pork chicken beef or vegetables The only complaint I have is the amount of meat they serve per portion They are inconsistent with the meat portion and can be frustrating at times They have two different sauces you can add to the curry which can add extra flavor (sweet and/or spicy) Service/Experience: 4 starsNo complaints with the service Plenty of seating space inside and no trouble finding parking out front We ate at Himilayan Cafe for lunch when visiting Virginia Tech for our older son We ordered the Pork spicy curry chicken curry and beef curry We planned on sharing family style but were dissapointed because we agreed that all three dishes tasted the same The meats seemed to be slow cooked in the sauce and absorb much of juices so they tasted very similar Curry was watery and very bland We had to add sriracha and it was still not very good I love all type of curries and have been all around the world including Asian and Hawaii and have gotten better tasting food for a lot less I mention Hawaii because they use the same currency and are usually more expensive because its an island and touristy After reading the 5 star reviews I was very excited to eat here but now I feel sorry for the students as they likely have very limited options on food Its hard for me to believe that $8 for white rice and a scoop of bland curry on a styrofoam plate is thought of as cheap I read a review that said that the curry tastes better at night because it simmers all day so I will give one more chance at night Large portions really inexpensive ready in a flashy Absolutely deliciousThis is Nepalese seasoning on NC vegetables I wish they were closer to me So unique and large delicious portions Almost ready instantly Who new there was &#34;fast food&#34; in the Himalayas? This place is really good and the employees are really sweet Each time I come I always have a wonderful experience The chicken biriyani is amazing!!! as well as the beef curry! My friend really likes the chicken curry as well I love this place and would go every week if I could Every VT student (as well as everyone else on Earth) needs to try this place! Decent price for a good portion of curry and rice I\&#39;ve never been disappointed from their food! The owners are also super nice and happy! I don\&#39;t usually post reviews unless a place is excellent or terrible I am here to tell you that this place is excellent I\&#39;ve been meaning to try it since they opened and finally went in today for lunch I had the butter chicken which may or may not be a temporary special They gave a generous portion of rice and the chicken dish which was delicious The chicken was thigh meat (I\&#39;m almost certain) which is usually not my favorite but in this dish it was great I don\&#39;t have a lot of experience with this style food but I definitely got an authentic vibe I recommend you try it for yourself Very good value for the price  I will be back Service was great and food was even better The spicy chicken curry had just enough heat and the flavor was amazing Portions are huge and the price is fair I\&#39;ll definitely come back Great spot to eat at if you\&#39;re staying at the Inn - it\&#39;s just across Prices Fork Definitely had a college-y vibe to it I felt like I was grabbing a quick meal between a last-minute cram sesh and rushing to my afternoon physics exam even though I\&#39;ve been out of school for 2 years If you like this type of food this place is good It\&#39;s basic and delicious And you can\&#39;t get this food anywhere else around here And did I mention it\&#39;s really good My favorite is the pork curry Simosas It\&#39;s worth a try My friends and I stopped by on our first night in town and the Himalayan Curry Cafe is a true revelation and gem It is modest in many ways - small storefront simple menu inexpensive prices and a single proprietorBut once we tasted the curries we were hooked for sure We each tried a different selection (except the veggie) which was easy since there are only four different kinds to choose from The pork was the best in my opinion but the chicken and beef were very tasty as well They are all saucy and served with basmati rice on the side and are made even better with hoisin or garlic hot sauce that is on the table Even the lentil soup was amazingly delicious and the next time I stop by I\&#39;ll have to try the cold Kheer (a sweet chilled veggie mix) The best part is that everything was a straight $550 with the lentil soup and Kheer being $300Did I mention this place was super cheap? I did about three times but it\&#39;s worth another mention We didn\&#39;t spend more than 8 bucks apiece and we were so full afterwards I think this may become a go-to spot for us every time we head to Blacksburg I REALLY wanted to love this little restaurant and tried it because of the great Yelp reviews The food is good but not great and certainly not worth a 5-star rating Perhaps I was expecting too much but after having really great curry in several Asian and Middle Eastern countries I know what I like and this wasn\&#39;t itThe food is simple bland and uninspired but portions are generous and the price is lowI had the lentil soup and vegetable curry (Yes I\&#39;m a crazy vegetarian) and both were ok -- again uninspired and blandThe restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly and efficient but I won\&#39;t be returning I ate there the whole time I was in Blacksburg Super fast Simple n reasonable food Best thing is you never have to wait Service Like fast food but with real good food Still remember their lentil soup !!! Owner is very welcoming and always greets with smile I\&#39;ve been here a couple times and their food is great! Clearly fresh and good quality And you get so much food for so cheap! Nice little restaurant in a convenient location And the owners are very sweet! This is my favorite restaurant in blacksburg because the food is always delicious and hot and just what you need I have tried all the different types of curry and my favorite is the pork sweet and spicy I\&#39;m not usually a big fan of pork but this pork is so tender and the sauce is perfect The sambosas are also really tasty If you want a fast cheap and delicious meal I recommend this place! This is the nastiest excuse for curry I have ever tasted We came here around 7 pm on a Saturday night I had the vegetable curry and my husband had the pork curry His included no vegetables (despite the menu description to the contrary) at all and a few chunks of meat in a lot of bland soupy sauce Mine had nothing in it that was listed on the menu Quite disappointingly it had no protein even though the menu listed &#34;curd&#34; I can\&#39;t fathom &#34;curd&#34; would mean anything other than tofu or perhaps cheese so I had high hopes for getting actual vegetarian protein The sauce was equally bland and the potatoes were not completely cooked Even the rice was disgusting It tasted like the water use to cook the rice must have had a weird flavor I make better curry than this at home using a box of Golden Curry from Kroger Although it would have been great to have gotten food that matched the menu descriptions of what we ordered I don\&#39;t think that could have saved our terrible meal Maybe I\&#39;m not used to how they make curry in Hicksville but this chicken curry had absolutely no taste The checking was also a little dry Find a better place The owners are so friendly and greet you with a smile I get half chicken and half veggie and it is delicious!!! I\&#39;ve tried the lentil soup Also delicious I basically always eat this in store to drown my curry in the red sauce Amazing Well add me to the long list of believers! While I can\&#39;t dispute west other reviewers have said (everyone has their own experience) I can say that this place is well deserving of 5 startsThis quaint little gem is located just behind Panera in the main shopping strip Inside you\&#39;ll find a very simple menu nicely decorated (although probably from what was here before) very clean restaurant As others have said the menu is basic - chicken pork beef and veggie with sides of lentil soup and keefer The main courses are $550 ($6 for beef)I ordered the Pork Sweet Spicy Curry and was not disappointed Huge serving especially in r the price lots of rice covered in a delicious sauce and about a dozen or so pieces of pork Contrary to others experiences my meal was very flavorful with a complex layering of spicesThe owners are some of the most welcoming and friendly proprietors I\&#39;ve met and are quick to welcome and wish you well when you leaveOverall I can\&#39;t believe it took 6 months of living here to find this place I\&#39;ll definitely be back soon! I wish I can rate zero star I found a flyin my meal! I can\&#39;t believe it! Disgusting Not sure why this got such amazing reviews Maybe I caught them on an off day or off time - during summer season But the chicken curry I received was hard and dry and tasteless Probably the worst restaurant food I\&#39;ve eaten in years Unless you\&#39;re a starving student who doesn\&#39;t care about food quality - I wouldn\&#39;t recommend The good thing is that they refunded my cost of the meal Simple menu superb flavors &amp; the owner is so nice! I will tell all my friends to check it out I ordered the lentil soup chicken curry and kheer Everything was delicious but I wish there was a little more flavor in the chicken curry But it was still tasty! I really enjoyed the kheer Large portions low pricesvery friendly service and the place looked very clean I would definitely eat here again Awesome place I highly suggest dining in I got carry out one time and it was kind of a disaster The togo boxes were maxed out with food (which I\&#39;m not complaining about) and spilled easily on the car ride home The atmosphere in the restaurant is nice clean and quite I wish this place was closer but it\&#39;s worth the drive! Pork curry is the way to go! I\&#39;ve tried everything on the menu at Himalayan Curry Cafe My advice is to go for the pork sweet spicy curry try the lentil soup at least once and don\&#39;t forget the kheer Tibetan curry is less heavy than Indian curry (not as creamy) and spiced a bit differently The chicken and beef curries here are rather bland and the veggie curry is even more bland (and possibly made with just frozen vegetables) The lentil soup is great but there is a sharp herbal flavor in the beginning that I still can\&#39;t figure out (perhaps it\&#39;s the black mustard seeds) and may not be to everyone\&#39;s taste The kheer is always good although some batches have more carrots than others (I prefer more cardamom)Something I learned by accident is that the curries taste better at night because (presumably) they\&#39;ve been simmering all day It\&#39;s a working hypothesis anyway The staff are super nice They keep extra-spicy sauce behind the counter if that\&#39;s your thing I find the pork curry to have a perfect amount of \&#39;kick\&#39; It\&#39;s cheap nutritious and generously-portioned Where else can you get a huge heap of fancy basmati rice as a part of a $5 meal? The food here is pretty good! They serve really large quantities and the prices are really low! You do get the food in foam plates and take out boxes but you pay for what you getThe owners are always here and they\&#39;re really friendly! I love this family owned local restaurant Very reasonably priced and the food is delicious!!I would come here just for the hot sauce it\&#39;s that good Disclaimer: I am of south-Asian descent so I am rather acclimated to eating curry dishes I might have higher standards than most of the customers at this place hence why I found it bland This place is perhaps good for a person who is attempting to dip their toes into the world of curry dishes I ordered the pork curry dish to-go and was disappointed For $612 after tax I received only 6-7 small pieces of pork and a whole box-full of rice with the sauce The sauce was a bit bland flavor-wise Another huge suggestion I have for the establishment is to switch their take-out styrofoam boxes to plastic ones similar to Chinese take-out containers The sauce leaked a little bit out of the box and into the plastic bag which resulted in an unwanted mess 1 star off for the disappointing amount of meat and another for the inadequate take-out containerNot sure if I\&#39;ll be returning again maybe to try other dishes because it is pretty affordable for a filling meal in Blacksburg Tried it for the first time today with the girlfriend and was pleasantly surprised!I got the Pork Sweet Spicy Curry and the Kheer while she got the Vegetable Curry and the Lentil Soup The Staff was EXTREMELY friendly and kind enough to answer questions regarding the food (ie The vegetable curry kheer and lentil soup are indeed vegetarian friendly)For $550 a pop they offer a generous helping of rice to curry ratio! I tried some of her vegetable curry and it was delicious The Pork curry only had about 6 pieces of meat in my serving and the rest was just the curry itself which was slightly disappointing The meat was a little tough but we went around 7:30pm (closes at 8:30pm) so that may be why? Like the other reviews have stated this Tibetan curry is not as strong (aroma/spice wise) as a traditional Indian or Japanese curry but still great none the less My girlfriend really liked the soup which had a very distinct taste of some seasoning (black mustard seeds?) that reminded me of tea The Kheer was unexpectedly amazing! It is an Indian rice pudding that is just absolutely delicious For only 3 dollars you HAVE to give it a try at least once Other notes to mention: The extra spicy sauce seems to be sriracha based so we all know sriracha goes with everything literally everything So you can\&#39;t go wrong here4/5 (for now at least due to the slightly dry pork/lack of pieces) but definitely will be back again (possibly at an earlier time of the day) A decent student type of place The food was okay but not great The meat was okay but not great Very much geared toward the students in the area Nicly priced meal clean tables and bathroom fast service This restaurant is very casual and simple The sweet pork had more flavor than the chicken and the Kheer was very tasty A perfect place to eat out on a budget Oh the spicy pork currybest thing to eat ever Rainy day? Post break ups? Test stress? Hungry? You can eat them any time and they\&#39;ll taste like the essence of comfort Ate here once a week all last year though a little sour they raised the price up by a whole dollarstill too tasty and cheap to past up though plus now they add more meat! Pretty much the best freshly made dinner option in the b-burg The food is very simple and if you are used to traditional curry from your home country this may not hit the spot But for the prices (raised to $650 but still amazing) the immediate service the friendly staff and the cozy decor I believe this place has earned 5 stars Great warm meal to grab after a long day of studying at the Math Empo This restaurant is located almost right next to Panera It must have been really nerve wrecking opening this place up right next to Panera but it sure has paid off! This place is neat and serves delicious foodfor only about $5 ~ $6! The clerks are friendly and the place is always cleaned I would definitely choose to eat here over Panera The menu is pretty simple It\&#39;s mainly curry with some other items that I never order I\&#39;m sure the other items are pretty good too but the curry is just unbelievably good for a $6 meal They also give you lots of food Make sure to go here with an empty stomach I LOVE Himalayan Curry Cafe The menu is simple the food is delicious and reasonably priced and the owners are extremely nice I eat here all the time- it\&#39;s my favorite restaurant in Blacksburg Eating here is as warm and inviting as eating a home-cooked meal This place is phenomenal for the price or otherwise Each of the curries is tailored to the meat (or lack thereof) The sweet and spicy pork is probably my favorite a medium-brown curry with loads of flavor neither too sweet nor especially spicy (the spice can easily be increased) The chicken is similar but not spicy The beef is a darker curry sometimes reminiscent of an especially good gravy The veggie is probably the most distinctive of the four although it reminds me of a basic (but excellent) Indian-style yellow curry The kheer is also excellent and very refreshing for something sweet Couple of hints: each of the tables has an orange-pink sauce He\&#39;s got a spicy version of this behind the counter if you ask which seems to be designed to go with the pork It\&#39;s awesome and I get it every time Also the portions are more than adequate (and totally fair for the price) but for those who might want more meat he will gladly give you more for under $2 The service is informal (cafeteria-style) but the tables and floors are clean and look nice This is a great place to take a date so long as your date puts food above &#34;ambience&#34; (all the best dates will)This rapidly became my absolute favorite restaurant in Blacksburg and given the price and quality I eat here several times a weekHighly recommended Great food and the amount is good for the price you pay especially if you do take out The service is splendid-had the cashier ask me if I needed water while i was eating Small simple menu flavorful well cooked clean food Inexpensive Owners are friendly nice people Will go back! Five stars for great food and portion size I leave full with a dancing tongue Super clean nice place I went once and returned to try the whole menu (Five main dishes) I enjoy the lentil soup on cool days They also have very reasonable prices and charming staff I wish lots of people will go so they can grow and prosper and add even more items!You will want to go again and again Enjoy! Simple but incredibly bland However it\&#39;s inexpensive and prepared so you get your food immediately If you want any spice ask for a cup of extra spicy sauce It definitely doesn\&#39;t deserve a 5-star rating but it\&#39;s fast cheap and easy Very friendly staff the portions they give are very generous given how inexpensive it is the curry itself is delicious and the facilities are well maintained/very clean You cannot find better food at this price The place is quiet and neat I will recommend their spicy pork curry This is a nice little hole in the wall surprise for Blacksburg The pork is amazing and you get so much for what it costs The people are always super nice and it makes you feel good to eat somewhere that the owners actually do appreciate your business The lentil soup is a good try as well If you\&#39;re not big on meat the vegetable curry is a good option! I enjoy the sweet spicy pork curry great flavor and a super friendly staff I occasionally study here as the restaurant has a comfortable atmosphere and the noise level is not too loud One of the best places to eat in Town now I eat here at least once a week In the 6 months it\&#39;s been open I have NEVER had a bad experience Can\&#39;t speak for the kheer or lentil soup but all of the curries are great Good food friendly owners and staff inexpensive pricing Can\&#39;t ask for much more! If you like it hot ask for the spicy sauce Wow What a treat Stumbled onto this little place while visiting family and was so impressed A delicious Tibetan curry that reminded me of Pakistani Balti curry Not a lot of heat but just loaded with flavor The curry is served right up behind the counter without ordering in advance I was in and out in two minutes and it was only 550! There\&#39;re only a few choices and this isn\&#39;t a restaurant for an elegant night out but it\&#39;s perfect for a quick delicious and inexpensive meal Hard to believe anybody in B\&#39;burg every pulls into a drive-thru with this gem around! Simple menu friendly service but wired curry It didn\&#39;t taste like curry Spicy pork curry is the best choice Well I\&#39;d give it 35 if I could I had the pork with the hot sauce Rice was good curry was fairly plain with pork chunks Nothing to write home about I make several types of curry and prefer any of them to this I really wanted to like this place The pork curry is delicious! Everything here is a little on the sweet side; even the soy sauce and mayo sauce on the tables are sweetened Excellent and flavorful food Our family eats here regularly and we are always satisfied with the offerings The menu is small with four types of curry lentil soup and a couple of other options The lentil soup is outstanding and the curries are all flavorful We will be back Tasty food at reasonable prices and great service I like to get the pork curry or the beef curry with lots of their yummy hot sauce My two year old daughter loves the curry which makes dining here easy for my family So glad this place has opened in Blacksburg! Food was good and inexpensive We had the beef chicken and veggie curries We tasted the spicy pork which I\&#39;ll definitely do next time My one major issue was all the styrofoam - plates and cups The chicken curry is very good for the price you are paying They give a great amount of rice and have delicious sauces to go with it They employees are always so friendly OMG MUST VISIT THIS PLACE IMMEDIATELY To place the food aside The kindness of the owner alone is enough for me to go Now bring the food into the picture HOLY They give you such generous portions for only $6 after tax The sweet and spicy pork is my fav and the sweet orange sauce they make I smother it in Their hospitality generous portions (enough to leave me full for hours and to the point where I ate way too much) and unique delicious food is great My absolute favorite place in Blacksburg! I come from Northern Virginia and even with Tech\&#39;s high ranked and wide variety food dining halls I crave the widely ethnic foods I have back at home Himalayan Cafe is inexpensive and soooo delicious You definitely get the most of your buck The food is simple yet delicious flavorful but not to too strong The people are so friendly Every time I come I\&#39;m always served by the same asian man and he is awesome! Absolutely in love with this place!!! I just stopped in for a quick lunch It is the best bite of food that I have had in Blacksburg I am a grad student and have been living here for three years it is literally the best thing I have had Very simple menu quick service and very reasonably priced New lunch place for me (I had the pork sweet spicy curry) So good! The owner has an amazing personal story as well Make sure you save room for kheer for dessert! Delicious and spiced up curry!! Ask for the extra spicy sauce if you like it hot!! Good portion for the price! Everything is a flat price food is fast yet of good quality fills you up and is fairly authentic (I am an Indian and dont make bad curries myself) Absolutely fantastic curries sweet and spicy pork was the best The price is a steal! Don\&#39;t forget to try the lentil soup and kheer The chicken curry is amazing Atmosphere is casual clean and chill Very reasonable prices too i have no idea why this place has 4 star rating must be mostly hungry students rating it i\&#39;ve eaten lots of curries in many places and countries and this place\&#39;s curry tasted like nothing literally nothing yeah the price is great but you\&#39;re paying for watered down food if you want food with real taste go to blacksburgthaicom or cafe-mekongcom both in Blacksburg Excellent! My kids pushed me past my favorite place in Blacksburg that being Gillies and it\&#39;s a good thing they did! This place has a simple menu but it\&#39;s all good Tasty cheap super clean friendly and (most important) great tasting food My son steers clear of most stuff beyond the very basics so when we walked in here - somewhat over his protestations we said we\&#39;d order and he could taste our meal and if he didn\&#39;t like it we\&#39;d take him to the Panera next door One bite and even he was hooked I gave this place a very poor rating when I first visited but I think this is the first time a restaurant has actually made me feel guilty enough to write a brand new review I had the chicken curry my first visit it was and still is not very impressive I immediately dismissed the place as bad and continued on with my life The problem was that every week I had to pass the place in order to access the parking garage Each time I passed my opinion of the place began to change The aroma of the ginger and curry spices flowed out onto the sidewalk the perfect balance of strong but not too overpowering The restaurant itself was amazing well kept with beautiful authentic decor And the owners oh how awful I felt when the owners said hello to me every single time I passed And thus I gave the place a second chance and instead of looking at the restaurant as food critic I looked at the feeling the place truly gave me a feeling of home I decided to try the beef and vegetable curry the lentil soup and finished with the kheer While the food wasn\&#39;t perfect it was genuine it had all the elements that made good south asian food Cheap comforting and simple This place IS one of the best spots in Blacksburg and has definitely made a loyal customer out of me Terrible taste of vegetarian dishes Only kheer is little decent I m nt going there again Great local place The owner is from Tibet The chicken was a little bland but the pork curry is awesome! He will let you sample anything first too :) Yummy curry options I chose vegetarian which was great (use the spicy red table sauce with it) Extremely friendly Tibetan native was the chef all in all pleasant and relatively cheap lunch I\&#39;ve only been here once but had a great experience Walk in get curry out the door fast Finally a place I can get chicken and rice prepared for a good price Im tired of greasy chinese food CHEAP!! and delicious I will be eating here frequently next semester Wow Stumbled on this place For a place that is so small and a bit &#34;divey&#34; for lack of a better word; it is really good Portions are very generous and have pretty good flavor It is also super cheap My only complaint is that its not spicy at all I had ordered it for take out so I didn\&#39;t use the sauces on the table but will do so next time I just kinda wish they would make it a bit spicier Great portion sizes and an awesome bang for your buck! The curry is very flavorful I recommend the beef curry make sure to get the extra spicy sauce The kheer is great as well What a fun evening! First time Amazing fianc\&#39;s son goes to VT 8:30 res &amp; place was packed So was bar Always a great sign Liz was our server Energetic attentive &amp; gave great recommendations- she is very passionate about the restaurant and the talented owner- she told us to save room for dessert The pasta with the mushrooms - I added shrimp - 3 BIG shrimp- outstanding Fianc got the lamb &amp; devoured it Of course we got dessert When I found out the ice cream was homemadecount me in Served with biscotti Fianc got the apple tarts tartine Beautifully plated &amp; SO good I was glad they sold Ruffino Prosecco in the little split Perfect for almost 2 glasses We will definitely return - great restaurant! Glad to find this beautiful small restaurant All dishes were excellent and enjoyable I was glad that they took a half order of Clam chowder and Cesar salad Bothwere superb Really enjoyed cesar salad especially small bacon were tasty Portabella and crab cakes were also great but the most impressive thing that I enjoyed was lightly sauced leafy salad Their balsamic vinegarette was outstanding (I found that the vinegarette sauce was from Italy!)Service was great and friendly at the beginning then when tables were getting full it was not consistent I ordered only a few starters without main entree and wish they brought them somewhat slowly When I was still working on salad and bread soup crab cake and portabello came all together Unfortunately I had most of those food when they got coldChocolate Bombe seems the most popular dessert It tasted as good as it looks Overall this place must be one of the high quality restaurants in town It is costly but for celebrating special occasion it would be wonderful spot This visit was okthe place is expensive for what it offers The waiter was nice but seemed to not really care that we were there or nothe did not invest in the dinner at all and for 16000 dinner tab he could have made us feel a little more special My daughter and I had dinner here while visited my Blacksburg In my opinion it\&#39;s the best dining experience to be had in the town The bartender made my daughter a virgin pina colada that was exquisite You could see the artistry in the glass and taste it in the cup Their wine menu is great so I had a nice Pinot and took the rest of the bottle (corked) with me when I left We shared a lentil soup Caesar salad charcuterie Board and some risotto for dinner It was such a tasty bit truly pleasant dining experience Cvs And one I will remember I hope for a long time Started off the meal by ordering a cheese slate (platter) with raspberry reduction and onion reduction We selected the smoked Gouda Brie and el trigal manchego Each one had a very different type of taste but was very tasty Gouda and Brie were on the softer ends in terms of softness but the el trigal manchego was firm They tasted very well with the crackers available The complimentary bread that they offer tastes amazing I absolutely love their bread Slight buttery with a bit of crunch Could you ask for anymore?For my entree I selected the tuna fish It was rich with flavor and juice plus the seasoning on it was pretty good I think the ratio of fish to rice was perfect; however if you are trying to get full from your meal I would not recommend this restaurant Finally we waited a long time to receive our checks The waiter/waitress did not come to our table that often and the situation was a bit frustrating I have been here about five times and it is still my favorite restaurant in Blacksburg! It is on the expensive side so not a restaurant I go to frequently but I love going to it on special occasionsThe menu changes all the time and all of the ingredients are fresh and cooked to perfection The waiters/waitresses have always been very attentive and I have yet to have a bad food or service experience here! Try the Charcuterie board! Who knew that a college town could have such a nice up-scale restaurant like the Black Hen?Let\&#39;s jump right into it The complimentary bread is REALLY good Don\&#39;t be afraid My friends and I ordered the cheese slate with 3 different cheeses The one that I would recommend trying it the brie! The brie came with a nice raspberry reduction which complemented the bread and brie very well For the entree I balled out and got the filet mignon or what I would like to call the filet migYUMMY One bite into the juicy piece of steak and I knew it was well worth it They cooked it to a perfect medium-rare! The steak was also accompanied by very tasty veggies and potatoes They also have a complimentary chocolates at the end (SO GOOD)!I want to add that it DOES take awhile to receive your food so beware The service was a little slow which was noticeable when it took awhile to return our credit cards after we paid If you come here plan on sticking around for about an hour and a half LOLOverall this is a really expensive place with pretty good food It has a really romantic vibe to it if you wanna take a date I probably won\&#39;t be coming back but it was good experience nevertheless Wow! This place is delicious! A friend and I had lunch here while in town for a girls weekend and we enjoyed it so much we made reservations for dinner the next night Everything was spot on from the cheese plate the filet and the lamb chops we enjoyed for our dinner to the Chocolate Bomb and creme brle we had for dessert Our favorite was definitely the Ruby My Dear cocktail What A Drink! Absolutely amazing dining experience! I will definitely be back when I\&#39;m back in town! Had an early dinner on a Saturday Menu was small but still a good selection of options Nice wine list I enjoyed the ribeye and it was cooked perfectly Not a huge fan of the addition of the Brie on top Enjoyed a nice meal The best meal I have had in blacksburg so far! Great service and amazing food A grownup place in a sea of casual restaurants As close to NYC as you can get in Blacksburg Incredible food even more incredible cocktails sophisticated atmosphere without being too stuffy Love this place OverpricedBad foodBad design and decor Not recommending at all They sat us a small table at a corner Both the restaurant and the food was cold Wow When did Blacksburg become so deliciously classy!? This is a higher end gem in the downtown Blacksburg area and definitely a keeper The filet mignon topped with baked Brie is beautiful (plated and in the mouth) and the chocolate bomb with raspberry is something magical I would expect from a high end restaurant in DC This one is worth the stop! I was informed as I was ordering that they had a new chef and it was his first week so I was a bit hesitant I started with the Blue Crab potato soup that was extremely good I then went with the Crispy egg which I was a bit hesitant ordering and paying $8 for one egg but OMG it was AWESOME and I could have eaten a dozen of them and gladly paid that price I decided to put my trust in and let the chef pick my entree since they all sounded amazing and the lamb chops that were brought out were great! This is NOT an inclusive spaceBrief rundown of a night gone awry My fianc was in town and some of my colleagues and I from the Vet School decided to get cocktails Usually we hit 622 and have a great time but decided let\&#39;s try another recommendation Black Hen/Bar Blue It began at 8:30pm Sat Feb 3rd 2018From the moment we entered something was off Maybe it started with the group of guys at the bar who did not let a single second pass from the moment we walked inside to gawk at my fianc and touch her arm and tell her how beautiful she was in a *surprised* tone of voice They were obviously regulars or friends of staff by the way they were being catered to &#34;Good&#34; I thought at least this place is attentive even to jerks who touch random women and make them feel uncomfortable Mind you all these men were middle aged white guys and we are people of color Reeks of &#34;coveting the exotic&#34; Did I begin to suspect something was up? It was bubbling on the inside yes but I wanted to believe this wasn\&#39;t that and maintain an open mind After all this place was recommended and we didn\&#39;t want to judge an establishment by the actions of a few of its drunk patrons  Now bar blue is tiny Like 4 or 5 tables total tiny and everybody is within a few feet of the bar Places like these its touch or go whether you order at the bar or get table service A brief scan of the room shows that it\&#39;s not very busy and there\&#39;s people with glasses of water cocktails and menus on their table A minute more of observation and we see waiters and waitresses checking in on the guests at the tables So we do what good patrons do We sit at one of the two open tables in the middle of the room and await our server Simple right?Here\&#39;s an important tidbit Our table is in the path of foot traffic for all the servers Clearly visible to everybody in the bar Again servers have to pass us in order to get anywhere From my seat I have straight line of sight and solid eye contact for every staff member going in and out of the bar Am I hammering the point in enough? You couldn\&#39;t miss us is what I\&#39;m saying**Ten minutes pass** with literally not a single server or host saying hello nobody other than those jerks at the bar acknowledging us nobody bringing us menus or offering us water Just walking right past us The entire time I\&#39;m making pleasant eye contact with the bartender who is behind the bar not more than four feet away from me in a failing attempt to get a server without being a tool Oh yeah! We are also literally a foot away from another table on our right that needed to be cleared for additional guests That table gets cleared and a couple sits down Within a MINUTE a server goes to their table gets them menus talks to them about the drinks and deserts available offers them water and takes an order And walks right on about her merry way Now something is def feeling fishy We are literally the only people in the bar that aren\&#39;t white And we are literally the only people being ignored My fianc is beginning to get that all-too-familiar feeling of disbelief/hurt/anger so I decide to make it social experiment and see how long it will take to get service at bar blue as a brown guy and a black woman There\&#39;s literally only five tables They can\&#39;t have missed us We\&#39;re right in everybody\&#39;s face At the fifteen-minute mark one of my friends joined us and I\&#39;m reminded to text the remainder of our group to avoid this place at all costs and go grab us a table at 622 because this is shaping up to be a huge fail As the only 3 nonwhite people in here we decide we\&#39;re just going to sit here quietly and watch everybody else get served while we are being denied water courtesy and acknowledgement of our existence completely Oh and menus and drinks too Ten more minutes and we\&#39;ve crossed our threshold for the BS Servers are actively avoiding eye contact now as they pass our table to check in on the other tables At exactly 8:55 we put our coats back on and leave Nobody looks at us as we leave actually having to manipulate our bodies to get around one server who passed us over a dozen times to serve the table immediately on our right in order to grab our coats on the way out This wasn\&#39;t a dress code thing we were all dressed professionally This wasn\&#39;t a behavior thing we sat there sober and polite This wasn\&#39;t anything except a deliberate attempt to not provide service to us Plain and simple As a person of color you are invisible at bar blue/black hen And I will be telling this story across all platforms and telling all my colleagues at the Med and Vet schools to avoid this place out of principle at all costs PS Management seriously? It\&#39;s 2018 We were already hesitant to move down here in as tense a social climate that we are in The stereotypes of this area exist How does it feel to know you contribute to that stereotype? Had a nice meal at the bar on Saturday night Shrimp cocktail was perfectly cooked and spiced mushroom pasta was rich and delicious and the cheese plate was very generous The best part was watching Brittany create perfect craft cocktails all night Drinking them was pretty great too She\&#39;s a talented bartender and a truly hospitable &#34;host&#34;! What a great restaurant!! Food was yummy Our waiter was superb and we had a beautiful graduation dinner and celebration!! Thanks Black Hen for just being you!! Great atmosphere fabulous and attentive wait staff The menu was very exciting and our dishes were perfection This place is so damn expensive ffs Go here if u wanna spend $35 on a succulent delicious meal but otherwise just hit Cabo The ambiance in here is kinda weird too but not bad Sound bounces off the walls very easily Don\&#39;t sit by people who are annoying Simply delicious! My ahi tuna was kind of skimpy in presentation and portion but it was very good My duck breast entree was absolutely mouth watering The meat was done to perfection and the sauce was a fantastic Too bad it was only one breast Top notch service! Outdoor seating! Will definitely be back The new Chef is a gem he makes the best crab cakes it\&#39;s been consistently good every visit The Black Hen is a great place to bring family and friends when they are in town The food is upscale fresh and creative The cheese board and the truffle-infused cheese was a highlight as was the mahi mahi with watermelon salsa Yes it is costly Be prepared to splurge Just be sure to call ahead for a reservation So glad such a cute and trendy spot is here in Blacksburg! First visit to Black Hen Friendly attentive waiter They were out of the duck breast and out of the rainbow trout Ordered roast pork loin Was very dry Served on very mushy bed of spinach beets and risotto We had an excellent lunch here! The cocktails were superb and even better still the food was very very good from a wonderfully lemony chicken salad sandwich with a whole lot of depth to a superb BLT and E and whoa- the special: a filet burger with saracha kimchi and a sweet bacon was out of this world The chef nailed the combinations of flavors in these dishes without going overboard And the desserts are a WOW We had to try two because the food so far had been so good! The apple tartin and the lemon merengue were both really really superb!! The foods are locally sourced (Blacksburg Bagels makes some of the best croissants in town and Black Hen is proud to use them for a choice in breads) Locally sourced chicken you get the drift And all this for quite an excellent value- the sandwiches were large and came with a choice of fries (perfectly done) or salad (very nicely put together) or a soup (another dish of beautifully blended flavors) for an incredibly well-valued priceAdd to this a beautiful dining setting friendly professional and well-informed staff and yes we were very happy customers! So Blacksburg has a great place for dinner now also a great place for lunch We were lucky to walk in i\&#39;ll bet they\&#39;ll be swamped soon as the area figures out they\&#39;re open for lunch now I\&#39;ve had this place described to me as \&#39;upscale\&#39; and \&#39;fancy\&#39; and \&#39;can\&#39;t really justify going there unless have something to celebrate\&#39; There is some truth to it It is certainly expensive relative to a typical Blacksburg restaurant out there The average entree on the dinner menu is $29 But if you do end up there that figure doesn\&#39;t get close to explaining the amount of effort put in by staff members you interact with and the quality and care with which the food is prepped and served I had the duck breast with roasted potatoes fried egg veggies with mango sauce The sauce was towards the sweeter end of the scale (pairing it with a dry sauvignon blanc worked) The meat was tender and medium-well done the potatoes only mildly crisp pretty perfect mealI tried their creme brulee as well quite alright They bring complementary chocolates with the checkI\&#39;ll definitely end up here again whenever I get the chance As usual I sat at the barThe ambiance was nice and not too dark It was pretty crowded when I came in around 745 on a Tuesday and just about empty when I left around 9 Service from the bartender was very good She was attentive and friendly and made some good strong cocktails She was accommodating when I asked that a drink off of their cocktail menu be altered with a different spirit but did end up shorting the pour which was very apparent in a martini glass Even so she was a very good server and I appreciated the skillfully-made booze!Crispy and herbed focaccia with a bit of olive oil and balsamic was a wonderful way to whet my appetite but I do wish it came out more than 2 minutes before my dinner That said it was perfect for dipping in the sauce that accompanied my entreeWhich brings me to the main course - flank steak medium rare with extra mixed veg instead of potatoes It was served with a creamy sauce with a touch of sweetness and mustard The dish overall was wonderful Great flavors from the steak veggies (zucchini squash onions sun-dried tomatoes) and sauce The steak was overcooked (medium almost med-well) and a little bit on the tough side but that\&#39;s really my only complaint as the dish was bursting with flavorOverall great service and good food For the price I wish the steak was done correctly and the first cocktail poured full but these are minor complaints for what is a great establishment in downtown Blacksburg 40/5 Amazing!!! Start with the Ruby my dear cocktail The French Hen cocktail is also delicious We were in town for the weekend and came here for Friday lunch Came back for Saturday dinner My fianc and I (both living in NYC for years) have been looking for a nice hand crafted cocktail place in the area and decided to try this place because of the glowing reviewsand I must say I was highly disappointed with the experience We walked into the establishment and sat down and not once were we welcomed with a hello nor offered water to drink or a menu However there was a couple next to us who came in 10 minutes later and their table was cleared they were seated ordered and we STILL weren\&#39;t welcomed I\&#39;ve lived in New York for years and have been at some highly rated restaurants and bars and have NEVER had an encounter like I did here The only conclusion I can make is because my fianc and I are both people of color which is very disappointing I truly hope the bar reads this review and reprimands their staff for discriminating especially for a place that looks sub par in comparison to what I\&#39;m used to in New York We had a group event with 33 people at the Black Hen We started with a happy hour and half the people hung out at the patio and half in the restaurant I love the patio because it\&#39;s comfortable and a great setting for social chats The staff is so responsive and was fine with running a tab or getting paid right away The dinner was great We had four choices for dinner: a beef dish a fish dish a chicken dish and a mushroom and pasta risotto Everything was delicious Dinner was served quickly Dessert was chocolate mousse topped with whipped cream and a raspberry It was SO smooth and silky and good One guest doesn\&#39;t like chocolate and the staff quickly brought her an alternate dessert: passionfruit/mango sorbet which was also delicious Liz and the staff did a great job The price was excellent for the great value You are welcome to see the review below that I did over a year ago I am guessing there were troubles for a whileNo longer! We had our office Christmas party herelast week for lunch Food was good to very good A few small complaints regarding the sandwiches Everyone loved the roasted potatoes and desserts! Our server Shana was excellent!! I have several food allergies and she gave detailed attention to those so I was able to have a delightful lunch and mango sorbet! Shana is the very best server we have had here My husband and I returned tonight and sat in the cute little bar Our dinners were superb! Our drinks too! My husband had a lemon drop martini: yummy! The bartender is very good and attentive I had a salmon cake with Sea Isle peas fennel andaioli It was top-notch! Totally delicious! My husband had sweet potato soup and oysters on the half shell Yum!! Go eat here over the holidays It\&#39;s a terrific way to celebrate! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Unhappy Anniversary! My husband and I went here to celebrate our 25th anniversary tonight We\&#39;ve eaten here many timesthat were truly excellent but that was definitely not the case tonight Service by the female bartender was mediocre at best Our entrees took 40 min to arrive and were frankly almost inedible We tried!My filet mignon was the worst filet I have ever been served It was lukewarm My sliced potatoes were dry and hard; the broccolini was SO overcooked My husband\&#39;s pork chop was not a chop at all Instead he was served chunky medallion-like pieces of pork Presentation was nothing like the description He left half of it on his plate His vegetables were as unappetizing as mineThe only positive thing I can say: after 25 years of marriage we were both trying hard to make this a nice evening and not create a scene We were more polite than we should have been we paid our bill with a purposeful lower tip and we left We\&#39;ve learned how to separate anniversary fun from a meal that is no fun Total disappointment! We won\&#39;t be back anytime soon if ever I wanted to leave this review because both chef and menu have changed this past weekend Please note that we are from out of town and had not been to this restaurant before the change We found the food to be wonderful and the service great We sat at the bar because there were no tables available and we were probably lucky to get that Bartender Andrew was fantastic Very knowledgeable about wines and drink He made several suggestions that made our evening better My wife and I split the Caesar which was quite nice I had the filet Cooked perfectly My wife had the salmon on a bed of green lentils also very good You should definitely make a reservation as bar seating is a hit or miss thing The menu is not super long Entrees included lamb chops salmon filet mignon and pork chop I\&#39;m not sure what the hype is all about I came here on a Wednesday around 7:30 pm and I was seated right away It\&#39;s not so busy probably because it\&#39;s summer break I ordered the watermelon wheat beer which was refreshing and the waiter brought a couple squares of bread I ordered the duck breast which was served medium rare with grilled squash and zucchini and quartered potatoes The duck was covered in some type of sauce that\&#39;s a little too sweet for my taste I was expecting the duck skin was seared and crispy with nice juicy MR meat underneath it per their description and the Yelp reviews The duck came out MR alright but the skin is far from being seared Duck has some really fatty skin so when not cooked properly in the case of this dish well imagine eating MR meat wrapped in raw fatty skin I love eating well-cooked skin because of its fat content but only when it\&#39;s crispy! Another thing worth noting is the ambiance of this place - it\&#39;s definitely not as much of a &#34;fine dining&#34; as other reviews have described Sure maybe this place is the only restaurant in town that\&#39;s considered upscale and maybe it gets more serious with their \&#39;dress code\&#39; when the university is open but every table but one (what seemed to be a table of gentlemen that got out of a meeting) wore t shirts and shorts Also the acoustic of the place is pretty awful You don\&#39;t even have to try to evesdrop to hear everyone\&#39;s conversation I noticed there was only two waiters working the front so the service was a bit slow On the good note they provide a free chocolate truffle when you pay the tab I have been here several times and every time was an excellent experience and food has been always on point &amp; delicious In addition some of their in house cocktails are exceptional! One of the better restaurants in Blacksburg Have had dinner here twice as well as lunch and all of our meals have been very good Had dinner here the other nightservice was friendly the kitchen was a bit slow but it did not bother us food was solid and the wine list was good Can recommend the crab cake the NY Steak and the duck breast Will definitely come ahead when in Blacksburg Best food in Blacksburg if you don\&#39;t count bbq! Great courses all around From salads to starters to desserts do yourself a favor and try ANY dessert! Excellent meal We had cocktails: Ruby MyDear French Hen and Barrel-aged Manhattan Cheese platter shared an entree and lovely lemon dessert Waitress was very nice and attentive I would highly recommend this restaurant Wonderful yummy and affordable The service was amazing and the decor is just right The ceaser salad was one of the best I\&#39;v ever had Also thank you for making food so yummy my 5 year old enjoyed eating off my plate Love everything about this place I\&#39;m a fancy yet down- to- earth outdoorsy foodie visiting form Austin TX and this charming little place drew me in immediately  Quant nice patio not too crowded Healthy yet hardy options The food and drink did not disappoint One of the best lunches I\&#39;ve had in a long time! Outstanding! Crab cake and fries I opted for no roll which was great for me The crab cake was all crab - no fillers at all and it was delicious! The fries were amazing! Soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside Yum! I even had the Ruby grapefruit cocktail Outstanding! I\&#39;ll be back AND I\&#39;ll recommend it to all my friends! So worth it! great restaurantwe came without reservation in a random Wednesday and there are no space! We only got a 2hour table before a reservation we ordered duck breastkobe steakcrab cakeall of them are goodand the chocolate bombs is amazing especially the raspberry sauce chips on the top! We went here only because they were open at 10pm at night They were only serving appetizers and dessert but wow! Their cocktails are delicious (try the ruby)- the ahi tuna was fantastic and our server acted as if we were his first customers of the evening not the ones holding him up Dessert was fantastic as well!  We\&#39;ll be back! I would give the food here a solid 4/5 stars I took one star off because the service we experienced left a lot to be desired We had an early reservation the day before July 4th and were seated promptly when we arrived The decor was a bit underwhelming considering the sophistication that has been proliferated about this place for the past few months It was a very simple bright space perhaps a bit poorly laid out for tables The wine glasses were lower quality pressed glassed rather than the nicer thin glass which was a disappointmentOur server who was probably a student was really slow throughout the entire meal It took about 5 minutes before he greeted us and as the meal progressed disappeared for most of it We got a bottle of wine for the table and the server was quite messy with the pours leaving several dribbles of wine on the table as well as the bottle Bread came out AFTER our appetizers which created a poor pace for the meal Perhaps most egregious was that he took away our plates without asking if we were done and WHILE I WAS STILL WORKING ON MY APPETIZER I was too shocked and he was too quick for me to say anything It was just extremely poor dining etiquetteThe meal itself was pretty good though I got the North Carolina trout with lump crab meat and the cherry tomato sauce Everything was well cooked and seasoned and tasted fresh The veggies were a bit al dente but I like mine barely balanced so I\&#39;m OK with that My appetizer was the shrimp cocktail and it was good if I had been able to finish it undisturbed The dessert menu left me wanting so I didn\&#39;t get anything though someone else at the table got the chocolate bombe which looked fairly good We did not receive the complementary chocolates with our check that other tables got that night (I noticed after we left as I was recalling the experience) Someone at our table left for the bathroom and reported back that the men\&#39;s bathroom that night had been completely trashed with no staff having attended to itOverall I would come back for the food but the service needs to be upped For what it\&#39;s worth I\&#39;ve heard OK things about service on other nights so maybe we just got a new server or it was an off night I have been here two times Both times we had fantastic meals They change up the menu so you can always try something different Wait service was fantastic and very helpful in suggesting meals we would enjoy We all ordered something different and all the meals were delicious Also save room for desert All deserts are freshly made on premises and also delicious We will be visiting again next time I am in town Food is good and Bradley is Great!Consistently good casual upscale American cuisine - the best food I have had in Blacksburg When you have Bradley the service is amazing and some of the best I have had My one suggestion for the food is that every dish has the same sides just different protein - c\&#39;mon chef!Lastly please put more lights outside so that I can see what I am eating and the people with whim I am eating We ate most of our meal in the dark! Wow the Black Hen has really hit its stride! The chef shows complete mastery of achieving tenderness and crunch in the same item seasonings strike a perfect balance and have great depth and ingredients are top notch The warm homemade bread was drizzled with olive oil displayed a tender crunch and a perhaps a touch of sourdough starter The blackened steelhead salmon (trout) had a solid layer of blackened spices that was not too hard and not too soft not too thick and not too thin bold but not overpowering the fish intriguing and not too peppery I requested it rare and a smidge in the center was indeed rare although if I were a chef of this skill level I would have gone even rarerMy only minor quibble was that my partner\&#39;s crab cake was too mayonnaise-y for my taste but he loved it Oh he also had the ahi tuna appetizer which was beautifully crusted with sesame seedsThe desserts were amazing the best I\&#39;ve had in a 150-mile radius One was a strawberry-rhubarb shortbread with vanilla ice cream layered between two buttery disks of shortbread replete with crystallized crunchiness topped with intense raspberry sorbet The other was a chocolate-banana pudding cake The roasted banana ice cream was intensely good and the chocolate cake was molten in the middle and again had that crystallized crunch on the outside We will daydream about them and will return to try other desserts We left thinking we were in a space-time warp and had somehow been transported to a big city for a meal My husband and I were walking in downtown Blacksburg and happened upon this gem Even in our shirts and t-shirts (grossly underdressed) they welcomed us We split the duck salad Kobe beef and creme brle Lovely Service was excellent Music enjoyable Food divine Pricy but you get what you pay for Would come back here again and again Very tasty food I enjoyed the atmosphere and the decor and every bite was very tasty It is very expensive for what you are getting Now that I\&#39;ve gone I don\&#39;t feel the need to go back however since I don\&#39;t think that the expense and experience match up well The food was OK but overpriced When we asked about the tuna appetizer the waiter completely misrepresented it saying &#34;it\&#39;s good for sharing&#34; and it was maybe 2 bites worth of food for 8-10$ Wonderful food and service don\&#39;t miss it if you are in Blacksburg We\&#39;re visiting VTech and we\&#39;re thrilled to find this gem Ingredients were really fresh dishes were interesting and overall the food was delicious I had an asparagus starter that was delicious For a main course I had the filet mignon that was cooked to perfection The steamed lemon cake was a wonderful finish to the meal Everyone in our party was very happy with their selections The strawberry salad was a hit (even if dressing was a little heavy) and the strip steak was a rave The desserts were all fantastic we sampled the blood orange spent and the chocolate mousse My husband was so thrilled with the creme brle he didn\&#39;t share They have a good cocktail menu and wine list to round out the meal The service was outstanding; attentive yet completely unrushed We were able to take our time and linger without any pressure to move on This restaurant is a must if you are in Blacksburg I can\&#39;t remember when I stopped in but I just grabbed a seat in the bar area (these are first come first serve and don\&#39;t require a reservation) Food is great for the most part; however at this price point I would expect to see more local food Some things are local within region but there is definitely opportunity to add more I also think this place would work great for half plates It\&#39;s not the kind of food you want to take home and the full plates are a bit large for me Had a great experience at The Black Hen Quaint little restaurant  food was outstanding and dessert was amazing We were a large group so we tried all the appetizers I felt they were a little on the small side  My only other complaint is that they charged $1 for extra bread  It\&#39;s not the money it\&#39;s the fact that they charged for bread Im pretty sure our total bill was $600-700 4 stars for bread charging and small appetizers However I will return The Black Hen and Bar Blue is a rarity for a town like Blacksburg in terms of both food and service quality The menu is on the smaller side but certainly didn\&#39;t feel like it as there were options that appealed to everyone in my party of three As a self proclaimed cheese addict I ordered the full ($21) cheese platter that contained a delightful variety of sharp nutty and mellow cheeses; certainly an excellent way to start the meal My entree (the delicious Pork Chop) continued to uphold the high bar set by the appetizer and was delightfully complemented by sides of redskin mashed potatoes and coleslaw Our server was personable attentive without being overbearing Overall the Black Hen is an excellent place for that special someone on your anniversary or just a celebratory treat (just be sure to make reservations for good seating)! I will be returning in the near future! Great bar Good food although I wish they would branch out a little Still only destination dining in Blacksburg Amazing food and really great creative cocktails! One of my favorite spots in Blacksburg We decided to give this place a try after hearing good things and it did not disappoint I got the pork loin and my wife got the salmon Everything was excellent from the food to the service I recommend making reservations as seating is a bit limited I had a hard time following the trend and giving this place any more stars than this and here is why:They are over priced on everything from drinks to dinner For the quality I can drive up the road and find better food/drinks for the price The food is good but nothing that special If they would knock the price down by just a small percentage I could have given them an extra star for thatThe drinksthe drinks are the reason my wife and I would frequent that place One of the only if not the only place in Blacksburg to get a real cocktail They had a good selection of drinks and the bartender that had been working would always come up with new and delicious drinks Not sure if he moved got fired or the restaurant went in a different direction but their drinks have suffered They only have 3-4 selections for their cocktails and the bartenders cannot even make a good Old Fashion The last one I had was horrible would have been better just to have whiskey on the rocks They need to change up and go back to be innovating with their drink selection I would have previously given them 4 stars on their drinks alone but sadly they are now mediocre at best and why they only garner 2 stars Perfect in every way! Food is amazing farm to table perfect portions and cooking exquisitely! Desserts and cocktails are also hand crafted and great! Be prepared to spend $$$ but completely worth it Great place glad somebody gets it that there are people in Blacksburg who really want a place like this instead of more pizza and beer NY strip steak was great with mushrooms on top lovely cheese plate for starter and fabulous desserts - lavender creme brulee and chocolate bombe Good service It did take a while for our entree to arrive after the appetizer but that was the only negative Prices are on the high side but we plan to see how the Blue Bar is maybe get an appetizer and a drink some nights and enjoy the relaxing atmosphere Highly recommend this place I am a food writer so I don\&#39;t dish out praise easily My wife and I were so excited to finally try this place as the Yelp reviews were generally positive and it is one of the few &#34;grown up&#34; restaurants in Blacksburg We were hoping to have a nice romantic dinner but were sorely disappointed To start the waiter took our drink order and for some reason it took 10-15 minutes for my wife to get her cocktail It was strange because it was a Tuesday and the restaurant was less than half full This is itself wasn\&#39;t so bad What followed afterwards wasFor appetizers she ordered the crabcakes and I ordered the cheese plate She said the crabcakes were just OK For my cheese plate the toast I was given to eat the cheese with looked NOTHING like the picture here on yelp They were small and thin--translucent even They literally broke under the weight of the cheese and I ran out of toast before even finishing half of the cheese I didn\&#39;t even have a chance to ask for more toast because our entrees arrived before we were even halfway finished with our appetizers! The waiter was nice enough and apologized but things like this shouldn\&#39;t be happening at a restaurant that claims to be fine dining It was like we were at Applebee\&#39;s or Outback during rush hour and the waiter was trying to turn tables fasterAnyhow even this might be forgiven if the entrees were excellent They were not My wife ordered the pork chop and I ordered the filet mignon Both dishes were really salty my wife\&#39;s to the point where she had to send it back She took 3 bites and had to chug a glass of water because it was so salty (the empty glass sat for 5 minutes--again a testament to the lacking service) She was so put off that she didn\&#39;t even want a replacement dish Mine was salty but my palette is not as refined as my wife\&#39;s so I could take it Overall I would say that the steak was just OK (by far not the best filet I\&#39;ve had) but afterward my mouth felt like I had just ate a tub of movie popcorn due to the generous use of saltOverall the night was not the romantic outing we had planned it to be I was there eating my steak while my wife had nothing meaning I felt pressured to wolf it down Again we were so disappointed not only with the taste of the food (we had really high expectations) but also with the general experience I guess next time we need to go to Roanoke if we want a higher-class meal Very delicious food: had the duck Drinks were amazing as well We sat outside for a lovely atmosphere Service was somewhat lacking as it took us about 30 minutes just for our server to take our drink order! Delightful experience We arrived early for our reservation and had a quiet drink in the cozy bar waiting a short time for our table Great French country ambience Our server Corrie was attentive and personable; very good Four of us split the cheese slate and shrimp cocktail for starters - highly recommended I found the pork chop to be ample and prepared perfectly; the light cream sauce with portobello and other mushrooms were savory and delicious I paired the starters with a Sauvignon Blanc and tried a glass of Malbec with the entree; it\&#39;s full spicy flavor was a compliment to the chop We finished with the chocolate bomb and a french press of fresh coffee - wonderful Black Hen earned every one of the five stars My wife and I came here for our anniversary I had notified the restaurant ahead of time of the special occasion and both the host and server greeted us with happy wishes for our anniversary - a very nice personal touch The food was fantastic The rosemary bread warrants a five star rating alone Service was great and the cadence of table visits was very well timed The only negative comment is that I\&#39;m sorry they\&#39;re not in our home town Exceptional wait staff who was very well educated in every part of the menu The new york steak was delicious; tender and flavorful and paired with the most delicious roasted potatoes; I didn\&#39;t know potatoes could taste so great Be sure to save room for dessert; the chocolate bombe is TO DIE FOR Absolutely the most well put together restaurant in Blacksburg if not the entirety of southwest Virginia If you are looking for quality fine dining in a charming atmosphere The Black Hen cannot be beat I will be sure to bring family and friends here for years to come The cheese plate here is worth every penny and the cocktails are delicious and the bartender is very accommodating to requests It will continue to be my #1 cocktail spot in town Their food is expensive which means this should be a upscale restaurant with a good environment But it is not it is way too loud Waiters and managers don\&#39;t want to do anything to stop some rude and loud customers from ruining everyone else\&#39;s dinner In one word you spent the money but you can\&#39;t get what you deserve Absolutely wonderful -- didn\&#39;t have reservation so we sat in the bar We started with drinks and the cheese tray which was great We all ordered different meals and shared The duck lamb chops strip steak and crab cake were ALL amazing The bartender was also our server and he did a great job We will definately be back!! The Black Hen &amp; Bar Blue is not worth the time and price I went there on a date with my boyfriend this past weekend and I have no intentions on going back The service we had was terrible the food was mediocre and overpriced and the venue made it nearly impossible to have a conversation without shouting across the table Service: From our arrival to our departure dinner took 25 hrs Way too long for a dinner if you ask me My boyfriend had made a reservation a week in advance and we still had to wait 15 min for our table Although our server was very friendly the service was terrible After being seated we were given our menus and placed our drink order He came back about 15 min later which we then placed an order for a cheese platter After placing the order our waiter said he would come back with our basket of bread It took 25 min till we got our cheese platter by someone other than him (so we couldn\&#39;t place an order for our meal yet) 20 min later after we finished the platter he comes back to take our order for our main course 30 min later our meal arrives 10 min into our meal our bread basket arrives Funny doesn\&#39;t the bread normally arrive BEFORE the meal? Our server doesn\&#39;t return back to our table until the end of the meal to clear the table which was unfortunate since I needed to refresh my drink mid-way through my course Ironically enough he was able to come back right away with the dessert menu which took another 10 min to receive the actual dessert (which compared to the rest of the night was very swift) He came back 15 min after dropping off the check (because it takes that long to take out a credit card) gave us his farewell and left Food: I ordered the pork chops and my boyfriend ordered the duck His duck was fairly good but nothing spectacular but certainly better than my pork chops My pork chops were mediocre; the sauce it came with was extremely salty and too overpowering to the point where I had to scrape off the sauce just to enjoy the taste of the meat I will say the roasted potatoes and vegetables were very nice For the price I expected better (I\&#39;ve had better) and a bit more unique The texture was great the taste was meh However the portions were a decent size; not so small like other high-end restaurants My favorite part of the night was the creme brulee we had for dessert It was absolutely perfect and although it didn\&#39;t make up for the service it was a decent way to end the night The creme brulee is the reason why I gave this place a two star reviewVenue: To keep it short the restaurant was too small which made it extremely loud The acoustics of the restaurant was just terrible I was hearing conversations that were happening three tables away from us and found myself raising my voice and leaning across the table just to engage in a conversation Not an ideal place to have a date or dinner where you actually want to have a conversation instead of a headacheTo me the biggest disappointment of the night was the poor service which made the whole dining experience a drag I would\&#39;ve expected more from a restaurant that claimed to be &#34;fine dining&#34; We went because we wanted farm fresh food The menu is small but with good variety Over priced for Blacksburg and some of the appetizer portions were pretty small We got the cheese plate and the ruby cocktail (our favorites) the soup of the day mixed lettuces salad ahi tuna crab cake (both seafood dishes were small) tofu pasta(good but not super special) chicken and flat iron steak (tender) Everything was delicious but nothing over the top with unique flavors minus the cheese plate My boyfriend and I just went here for our anniversary I ordered the sangria for a drink and it was amazing in its cute little mason jar I ordered the shrimp pasta and he got the mushroom chicken The vegetables were so fresh and the presentation was great! He absolutely loved his dinner (I\&#39;ve never heard him say &#34;this is so good!&#34; So many times I thoroughly enjoyed my meal the shrimp were huge and fantastic I absolutely loved the atmosphere one of the classier establishments in the area The environment had a French feel to it I would highly recommend especially for a date night The restaurant is smaller which contributes to the romantic mood so I wouldn\&#39;t recommend it for very large parties or plan on splitting into smaller groups Overall I highly recommend This was some of the best food I\&#39;ve had in my life Small little restaurant with great service (we had Brice and he was the man) and a great atmosphere The food didn\&#39;t take long to come out and the presentation was great If you are planning to have a cheap night out this is not the place to go BUT I highly recommend that you go at least once Dinner for two and a few drinks will set you back about $100 but definitely worth every cent Incredible Started off with an amazing seared ahi tuna Then had a pork dish in a cream sauce over pasta Dessert was the chocolate bombe that was out of this world I had my first trip to The Black Hen last night Let me start this by saying that a restaurant like The Black Hen is something that Blacksburg has desperately needed! Conceptually it is well executed with a coherent menu from start to finish a nice atmosphere and generally helpful staff (with one exception that I will get to later) My husband ordered the grouper entree and I had the flat iron steak Both entrees were delicious- flavorful and well seasoned however upon receiving them I wondered if perhaps they put both plates outside to chill before serving They were both stone cold! I have the distinct impression that both meals were plated and then sat to wait for my potatoes to be finished off as the potatoes were the only hot thing we received My steak was actually cool to the touch while the potatoes were piping hot At nearly $30 a plate I expect my food to be served warm I told the waiter that my food was cold and while he was gracious enough to offer to have another plate brought out he also told me that perhaps I shouldn\&#39;t order my steak medium-rare if I wanted it hot Are you kidding me? So apparently my cold steak was my own fault! The last time I checked a medium-rare steak should be brick red in the center but still cooked and warm That is a big difference between a fully rare steak and medium-rare I got the distinct impression that I would really be putting our waiter out if I asked for a fresh cut of meat so I ate what was served as did my husband- but we left disappointed The dishes were wonderful in conceptualization and flavor- but the kitchen needs to work on its timing Letting food get cold in order for the potatoes to finish cooking is poor form (I really think that this is what happened) Hopefully over time The Black Hen will work out these kinks and get its stride In the mean time I will be returning again to give it another shot hoping for food of the same calibre served hot! *On a side note- while this was my first trip to The Black Hen it was my husband\&#39;s second time going He said that it had improved from his first visit with food coming out more speedily Additionally the first time he went they charged the table for bread (seriously? Is that not compliments of the restaurant?) and this time they did not do that which I was happy to see I wonder if they had complaints about charging for bread and they changed their policy No more driving to Roanoke for a good dinner!! Finally Blacksburg has a sophisticated restaurant     small place small menu but everything was great Service was friendly and knowledgeable We had the cheese plate and the mixed greens salad a nice combination to start off with The steak filet and chicken were cooked perfectly and the sides were terrific Lively atmosphere friendly bar   looking forward to a return visit I brought visiting family to the Black Hen on recommendations from a few friends My first impression walking in was not amazing We went to open the door which looks like a &#34;push&#34; door Tried pushing a few times and then felt silly because it was a &#34;pull&#34; door We laughed it off then walked in and jokingly asked the hostess how many times she sees that a night She had absolutely NO response and instead stared at me blankly like I was an idiot didn\&#39;t even ask if I had a reservation or how many were in our party I\&#39;m a pretty chill person so I just moved right along and told her my name for our reservation She coolly showed us to our table and moved along She just didn\&#39;t have a great &#34;welcoming&#34; presence (Contrast to the hostess and waitress we met at Poor Billy\&#39;s the night before who were so friendly and genuine one point for Poor Billy\&#39;s) Our waiter never introduced himself was very quiet and just wordlessly smiled at us every time he walked over but did a fine job (maybe he\&#39;s an introvert?) Fortunately the food was AMAZING The flat iron steak had THE perfect seasoning cooked perfectly great asparagus and potatoes for a side The salmon was excellently cooked and came with a unique pasta (trofie) which I had never had and I\&#39;m SO glad I did You could get the same dish of trofie with grouper instead of salmon (the grouper was fine nothing special) The best part of the salmon/grouper/trofie dish though was the best tomato sauce I\&#39;ve ever had I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;ve EVER had a tomato sauce that I thought was anything special but I could have eaten it plain with a spoon (The pre-dinner focaccia bread was also delicious but charging an extra $1 per person for extra bread seems a little penny-pinching considering the cost for the entrees)Last we shared a few desserts -- the chocolate-nutella (molten cake) and vanilla (creme brle) Both were excellent (loved the fruit on the creme brle and the nutella ice cream) Nice touch at the end with small pieces of rich chocolate/nougat delivered with our billOverall four stars for the amazing menu and unique flavors that were perfectly done One star off for the less-than-welcoming staff Comparable in cost to the neighboring Poor Billy\&#39;s maybe with a slightly more &#34;serious&#34; atmosphere (read: less-welcoming more stuffy) but the entrees were a little more unique as well (also a smaller menu than PB\&#39;s)(Side Note: This restaurant needs to sort out their location on googlemaps because my googlemaps app on my iPhone kept trying to give me directions to Social House instead!) What a great place! Food was excellent and Brice our server was perfect! I would recommend to anyone Had the pleasure of dining here this weekend Very quaint location and loved the intimate interior Our food was excellent but given the reviews and the prices I was a touch disappointed We ordered the cheese plate it was very good but we get cheese all the time in Atlanta so I can\&#39;t rave about it The brandied cherry ice cream was excellent I was a little disappointed in the duck dish I ordered First the skin was not crispy which was disappointing Next I didn\&#39;t understand the hard cooked duck egg on top of a potato It had no flavor I don\&#39;t think potatoes really go with duck anyway They were tasty The green bean medley was very tasty The flavor of the duck was good but the dish was just weird to me My husband had the beef tips and was also a bit disappointed in that dish as well Probably wouldn\&#39;t pay the prices and hassle to get a reservation to come back with restaurants like 622 North (amazing flavors) already in Blacksburg Can\&#39;t rate this bad but just doesn\&#39;t stack up to the hype Maybe with a better executive chef or better management it could Sorry Great meal in a cool location Small place with great service and excellent food Good specialty cocktails with an small but decent wine list Got several appetizers which were all good Not a huge menu but several main course offerings Got the Grouper entre which was great Fish was perfectly cooked which can be a challenge if you don\&#39;t know what you\&#39;re doing Great deserts as well Best upscale dining in Blacksburg This restaurant is delicious! My fiance and I have been here several times for a nice meal The service is great the sangria is amazing and the bread well let\&#39;s just say it was freshly baked and mm mm good! I have gotten the chicken and the duck and both were unique dishes and very tasty I will definitely be returning the The Black Hen! Hands down the best restaurant in Blacksburg The crab cakes and the steak are to die for Perfectly cooked and amazing flavor It isn\&#39;t cheap but honestly totally worth the money For the NRV this might be the best &#34;nicer restaurant&#34; or &#34;grownup&#34; as another reviewer put it Its really not super fancy and the decor was a little weird (modern white walls matched with country cabinets and rooster quilts on wall- which was not my taste) But the food was good I think the food profile could still be enhanced as some were great and others ok I would say the portions are a bit on the small side I would HIGHLY suggest that the owners get a curtain from the ceiling or something else to put around the door area to keep the winter cold out If you are sitting near the door the breeze gets you The place is too small not to have a weather barrier there They also need an additional coat rack I love to cook and I\&#39;m often disappointed when I eat out However the Black Hen is an exception The food is delicious and unique it\&#39;s the only restaurant in Blacksburg that I don\&#39;t mind spending significant money at It\&#39;s worth the experience First don\&#39;t expect to order what you see in pictures on yelp as complained about in an above rating; this menu changes from one week to the next Although a little noisy the food is worth the price and the atmosphere-C\&#39;MON it\&#39;s BLACKSBURG I read a complaint about waiting for a cocktail It\&#39;s a small restaurant with one bartender Deal with it Perhaps whomever needs their alcohol that fast should have one at home before arrival or check into a 12 step program Food:Top 3 filet I\&#39;ve ever had and I\&#39;ve eaten all over the world I have been several times and very happy with everything I\&#39;ve ordered Cheese plate not to disappoint I ordered the (local) heirloom tomato salad both times this summer which is my favorite and loved it Finally someone who can make it better than I can Never presented the same way twice using different cheeses and sauce reductions Service personable professional knowledgeably yet fun every time Love this place Posted on Google but I had to tell it again on yelp because Lefty\&#39;s made my Friday!!Everything was fantastic!  Fish special was on point kids burgers were well received! Artichoke appetizer was off the hook! Our waiter Giuseppe could tell our kids were about to come unwound and made a special effort to get them some fries quickly! He literally saved the day! He was also right on target w/ his beer and wine recommendations So impressed w/ the food service and a waiter that really took pride in taking care of our family at the end of a loooong week!  Thanks to George for putting all this together and thanks again to Giuseppe for being an awesome waiter We will be back soon This is my son\&#39;s new favorite place to eat so we decided to check it out on a recent Saturday night visit At 7pm we had to wait a bit for a table which was not surprising for a party of 9 but it wasn\&#39;t bad and smaller tables were being sat in a decent time We started with the spinach dip and nachos as an appetizer The spinach dip was flavorful but not as creamy as you would expect The nachos were definitely the better choice of the two - a decent size and good amount of toppings The kid had a burger (as several others at our table did They are a nice size and cooked as ordered A bit of a warning - they come on toasted sourdough (which is fine for me) but they have Kaiser rolls on request I had the steak au poivre It was a perfectly cooked NY Strip but on the thin side and had a lot of gristle The other person at our table experienced the same It came with a big pile of mashed potatoes (not a lot of flavor) and the veg of the day which was broccolini The sherry cream sauce was good but the quality of the meat means I probably won\&#39;t order it again Hubby had the lasagna which was just &#34;meh&#34; in his words Our server was friendly but the timing was off We got our salads after our entrees and drinks remained unfilled We\&#39;ll probably go again when visiting only because our adult son likes it but we\&#39;ll stick to the burgers Excellent food selection! Beers and ales outstanding menu Told the waitress we wre on a tight schedule a d kitchen and food were excellent and quick! Sea bass was to perfection chicken cordon bleu great all fresh and made to order Russian porter beer was great! Really enjoyed the meal and excellent service woth the trip !! We stopped at Lefty\&#39;s following an appointment in Blacksburg Nice spot for lunch on a Monday afternoon Good selection of burgers sandwiches and salads Can get a lunch combo (half sandwich/salad or half sandwich and soup) I had the pimento cheeseburger while my husband had the Mediterranean burger Both were very good and recommended Brunch at Lefty\&#39;s is such a treat! I could become a regular there eating daily if my wallet permitted it So many tasty dishes! We went to Lefty\&#39;s for lunch on a Saturday The hostess was great and showed us to a table right away The silverware was wrapped up in a paper napkin clean on inspection I hate when I\&#39;m given utensils and they are smeared or not completely clean We started with sodas for the guys and coffee for me They have the best testing coffee I have ever had Nice full roast with no bitterness We ordered fried cheese curds for an appetizer only because we had never heard of it What a treat! Not greasy at all and the dipping sauce was great I ordered an ahi tuna salad It was presented so beautifully that I didn\&#39;t want to touch it The tuna was pan seared and excellent! It was topped with crispy fried Asian noodles 10 out of 10 My son Rick had a Philly Cheese Steak with onions mushrooms bell peppers and melted cheese He said it\&#39;s the best he\&#39;s had in a long time Josh had a pesto cheese burger which he loved The side of onion rings was homemade and not greasy at all and the French fries were great!My only regret is that we hadn\&#39;t found this gem sooner! Great menu Good prices Sauces very good Scalloped potato was fine Now tlookhe rest: service was poor - waitress didn\&#39;t say the specials know the menu or care The food looked 5 star but tasted two The risotto was disgusting My advise stick to the sandwiches and beer and it will be fine The fancier the worse it is In response to George Thanks for your reply Your deflection of any admission of guilt on part of Lefty\&#39;s is impressive Pink center is acceptable cold pink center to the point so much blood the bread is soaked is unacceptable we made it known we were uncomfortable with the seating they didn\&#39;t move us They did not offer to remake burgers she offered to take the same meat with condiments already applied to be cooked further That\&#39;s unacceptable I will gladly talk to Frank if I see him but I will no longer patronize his establishments Wow! This is now the worst place we\&#39;ve eaten in Blacksburg Multiple open tables they stick us in a corner sandwiches between kids and a large family taking more than a lions share of the table space Ordered nachos and they were decent so that helped the situation then came the burgers incorrectly plated without requested condiments easy fix Switch some things around all good we grab our burgers ready for that first succulent bite Of bloody undercooked cool to the touch meat Definitely not medium as ordered They did offer to take the meat back to the kitchen and heat it further we just took our lumps paid for inedible food (full price mind you) and went to Abby\&#39;s on North Main where they serve real food Frank Perkovich as good as 622 can be you\&#39;ve really let this one go Employees did not have a care in the world about it either Not surprising at peak time of day it wasn\&#39;t even busy wait staff told us you left early today because business had been so slow I see why I went to Tech and never in the 10+ years I\&#39;ve been coming to Blacksburg have I been to Lefty\&#39;s I knew their old location but never went in because it was out of the way from downtown and other stomping groundsI\&#39;m glad we checked this place out for brunch! We had a dog and were easily accommodated despite the patio being closed due to impending thunderstorms In addition the waiter brought over a small bowl of water for our dog and when she was done brought over some more So thoughtful!I got the California Scramble with a side of tomatoes and sour dough bread It was nothing groundbreaking but well cooked and came out in record time It would have been easy to have forgotten us outside but our server made sure that we felt special and well taken care of Went there for lunch and food was really good The sweet tea was great We got the chicken buffalo dip as our appetizer It was great! The dip tasted fresh and the bread was amazing Liked by all at the table and highly recommend!We tried the quesadilla daily special and steak salad All of the food was very good Will be back! Food was decent not great Service was average Beer selections were awesome The aesthetic is also particularly un-charming But some of the artwork from the Chinese restaurant it previously was is still there which was kind of fun The food tasted mostly like high quality airplane food Lots of fat and salt Could be our fault was we ordered the truffle mac and cheese and the chicken pesto gnocchi But both were a bit much and not in a good way The gnocchi was not great The service was also wholly adequate A reasonable place to go for dinner but I probably won\&#39;t seek it out again On the way home to the Nashville area from DC We are all getting hungry and little man is getting restless (1 year old grandson) We left about 5 that morning so it was still breakfast time by that time I was in a Cracker Barrel state of mind and set my sights my appetite and the GPS for the closest one I\&#39;m driving and the lady is telling me turn here turn there - my wife not the GPS so this gives my son-in-law the opportunity to search for something different He is one of those people that likes to try local places and mom and pop shops &#34;Anybody want to try Lefty\&#39;s? It is only 10 minutes off the interstate&#34; Sure why not? We pull into the parking lot of what was probably some sort of steak house in a previous life We get inside and discover it was some sort of oriental restaurant in yet another previous life - that or Lefty is into intricately carved wooden dioramic artwork pressed between two pieces of glass It was redone rather nicely - simple but seemed clean It is also a craft brewery But even I draw the line at beer for breakfasta thin line but a line nonetheless Is it 10:30 yet?Their breakfast specialties seem to be omelets and egg &#34;scrambles&#34; - basically an omelet\&#39;s cooler brother - loose scattered - likes to party with all the ingredients - a free spirit as opposed to the uptight and tidy omelet Everyone got omelets - except one of us - yeah me I went with the special scramble of the day - a little bit of this a little bit of that and some more of that It came with there soon to be almost famous Lefty\&#39;s potatoes! And the crowd goes mildThey were good - basically cubed potatoes with onions green peppers and this and that and something else Presentation is not their strong point If they wanted the potato serving to appear to be larger they would put them in a small bowl or put them in a stack using a smaller plate - sort of a culinary trompe l\&#39;oeil (Google it) Instead they are scattered and strewn - wait are we Waffle House? - on half of a large dinner plate - well breakfast plate I guess plate names depend on the situation Were it midnight it could be an &#34;I am drunk on my butt and am eating this to cure the munchies and hopefully sober up&#34; plateThey offer different types of toast and in-house made bread Today was eggnog bread and apple cinnamon bread They were OK I would go back were I in the area - don\&#39;t know it I would make a 20 minute detour again I went with my sister to Lefty\&#39;s for the first time about two months ago The service wasn\&#39;t all that great but the foodyum! I ordered the mango chicken sandwich and it was pretty f\&#39;n great So great in fact that when I went for my back last night with my friends I ordered it again This time however my experience was the complete opposite of my first The service was awesome My mango chicken sandwichwas not I barely had any caramelized apples AND barely had any of the mango salsa Mostly just bread chicken and red peppers My mouth was so dry I had to ruin my buzz with a water Mixed feelings about this place but I\&#39;ll give it another try We stopped around 10:30 AM on Sunday The restaurant had plenty of seats We were seated right away Our waitress was very friendly She walked us through the menu and provided some suggestionsWe started with beignets which was very cake-y It was more &#34;solid&#34; and more fried than a cake doughnut We did not like them at all We ordered Chorizo burrito Pimento Grilled Cheese French Toast and Jerk Chicken Omelet All the breakfast entrees were very good I tried a little of everything Pimento Grilled Cheese was simple with a little spiciness Chorizo burrito and Jerk Chicken Omelet were both very flavorful French Toast was crusted with cereal and cinnamon It was sweet even without the syrup Is this the only place for breakfast on Sunday in Blacksburg?? Apparently it is for large groups (a group being four or more people!) The entire time we were there I was fantasizing how I could open a breakfast location in Blacksburg and excel - just by serving hot food and remembering to refill coffee We had a group of six and we waited 40 minutes for a table Then about ten more for coffee and once we were served we waited again for our silverware Most of the food was cold by the time we were able to eat it The food was average And cold The servers were all friendly accommodating and to their credit working very very hard!! Probably just made some bad choices considering the other favorable reviews The beer was fine but not great Had a New England IPA and a Pale Ale The Pale was pretty yeasty For food I had a half order of the fried artichoke hearts peppers pineapple The half order was enough for 3-4 people More batter than peppers or artichokes Since it was pretty heavy I had an Asian chicken noodle salad It was ok but nothing more than lettuce canned mandarin oranges 6 chicken cubes and way too many fried noodles Only ate about 1/3 of the noodles which was plenty on the salad Overall there are better places to spend $30 bucks This place has the best short ribs I have ever had And the beer is good as well Just had the brunch and the omelet was perfect Lefty\&#39;s has pretty good food but the service is less than par Truly a good place for a good Brew but not the place to go for good service We came here on a Sunday after the UVA game and there was a wait (which is normal) We were seated in about 25 mins which wasn\&#39;t too bad The waitress was friendly but she was missing for most of the meal She didn\&#39;t check up on us and because the food took so long we were constantly out of drinks We flagged her down 3 different times for refills and one time we just stopped another waitress who was walking by The food took forever!! There was 3 of us and we ordered one ham omelet one bacon egg sandwich and some version of a salsa verde scramble It took them 45 mins to bring us food! The plating of the food was also very sad Its Iike they didn\&#39;t even try I\&#39;m sure we could have cooked this for less at home We wanted to love this place but we were very disappointed in the quality of food I came here for the first time with my parents for lunch The staff was nice and it had a nice atmosphere but overall we were very disappointed in the food Spinach artichoke dip- THE DIP WAS TINY in comparison to the amount of chips we got and the size of the plate It would\&#39;ve been better if they just gave us less chips The dip itself tasted good but it was such a small amount Cream of porcini mushroom soup- 5 stars; it was BOMB I personally love soups and this was one of the best cream of mushroom soups I have ever had Had a very full flavor and was not too heavy The porcini mushrooms really give it a deep mushroom flavor Jerk chicken sandwich- parents said it was okay not too good and not enough flavor &#34;Not enough jerk&#34; -dad Ahi tuna salad- 1 star; this salad was disgustingly sweet The cashew brittle is coated in sugar and the sesame ginger dressing was also unusually sweet It also only came with 5 small pieces of ahi tuna that were not seared enough at the edges It was pretty hard to eat Overall- maybe we didn\&#39;t order the right things on the menu but that\&#39;s not an excuse The overall quality and taste was very disappointing except for the BOMB CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP I love Lefty\&#39;s! It is so good but can get pretty crowded especially at dinner time on a weekend It\&#39;s less busy at lunch time or early dinner -- we went at 4 pm and there was still a good number of tables that were taken but we were seated and had good service throughout the night I\&#39;m not a beer drinker so can\&#39;t comment on the brewery and quality of it but my grandpa had a few and really enjoyed it The BLT is very good! Also had the avocado grilled cheese and it was great and it is one of the cheapest things on the menu Sandwiches are on the cheaper side on the menu and they also have more expensive options The brunch is very good as well but super busy on weekends expect a wait However the brunch menu is so good! Everything is good highly recommend Always a great go to spot at VT! Good happy hour deals We always get the pulled pork and truffle Mac and cheese flatbread Absolutely delicious! The service is always awesome! They even always fulfill my request for an extra pickle on my boyfriend\&#39;s pickle beer so i can steal it :) These two stars are for the brewery I sit at the bar and order fresh beer Hell I\&#39;ll give it a third star now for the bar And the staff who have to serve the consistently uninspiring menu; they are always doing good work (and the ones who don\&#39;t don\&#39;t last) I have seen this place go through cooks/chefs like &#34;insert fast moving thing here&#34; Not even close to it\&#39;s sister restaurant 622 North but that\&#39;s a different review The menu was sort of fresh back in 2008 when it was a tiny sandwich shop but it\&#39;s dated now and apparently Frank can\&#39;t find anyone to execute the darned thing You\&#39;re a full-fledged restaurant now Time to step it up Lately I\&#39;ve seen some dinner specials that look promising like sous vide short rib with pureed parsnips but y\&#39;all are still over dressing fish Fish doesn\&#39;t need a bunch of fancy clothes just cook it perfectly and give me a bit of thoughtful sauce Stop saying (and serving) veg du jour Compose the dish If you wanna cut costs then reduce the size of the menu and send it back to 2008 where it barely belongedBut the brewery is making magic Guess I better pop on over to their yelp and share the good newsAvoid the sheep at brunch by sitting at the bar Have some time to kill Make friends with the staff Game day brunch? Good luck!Black beans in the guac? Why? Was there ever goat cheese in the herb goat cheese spread? #SadPS I know you reply to every review George That\&#39;s good business and I know you care You are doing a fine job with what you are given Extra albeit verbal star for being a great leader Lefty\&#39;s is one of my favorite places to eat in Blacksburg Great variety of sandwiches and burgers and great selection of craft brews We ordered steak salad flat bread pizza  pork chops and the pasta with marina sauce we order the delicous mint sangarias that were delicious everything was great it was nice eating outside with the fresh air I\&#39;m torn on this one Some of the experience was 5 Stars (like the chicken salad sandwich) then some of it was 3 Stars (the Nachos) Then there is the potato salad that\&#39;s probably a 4 but it was so spicy I didn\&#39;t eat but one bite The server was friendly but not super attentive I might go again to pick up a chicken salad sandwich but other than that I\&#39;m not sure Had dinner here last night and we had the most amazing waitress Erin She was fun knowledgeable and gave wonderful service Ask for her because it is the best service that we have had here Find was goid we had spinach dip appetizer and burgers Meals were good Erin was there throughout the meal but no in an obtrusive way She made the evening a delight As a VT alum I\&#39;d heard great things about Lefty\&#39;s and only got the chance to dine after graduating The menu looked amazing for brunch so my sister and I decided to try something new and venture over Something strange to us was that brunch was only served until 11:30 am (Sat and Sun) however if you got there before 11:30 am you could still order off the brunch menu The wait was about 15 minutes when we arrived but we were sat no more than five minutes later Our server was prompt in taking our drink orders despite the busy restaurantMy sister and I decided to split the Croque Sandwich as well as the Pimento Grilled Cheese while my dad opted for the Bacon and Apple Omelet (which came with an option of either white wheat or rye toast) Our food didn\&#39;t take too long probably 10 minutes max I guess we didn\&#39;t read the menu close enough as the Croque Sandwich was on sourdough FRENCH TOAST Neither of us cared for the sweetness The inside flavors were good but there wasn\&#39;t enough sauce to cover all the meat Traditionally a croque is battered and baked/fried but this one was neither The Pimento Grilled Cheese was not as named or described The menu boasted &#34;Homemade spicy pimento cheese scrambled eggs and tomato on grilled sourdough bread&#34; but rather it was scrambled eggs MIXED with pimento cheese and buttered bread Not grilled cheese and severely lacking pimento Either the name or description of this item needed to change Luckily the omelet was unique and delicious so 1/3 here! Service was solid restaurant was clean and plenty of parkingConsidering the low prices ($27 for all three plates + a drink) it isn\&#39;t a bad deal I\&#39;d be willing to try it again for lunch Keep an eye out for the high food tax ~12%! Great place for a quick and casual lunch or brunch Really cute atmosphere and great service I really liked the burger and my egg scramble Good amount of food and quality for the money A year has passed since I posted my initial review Since then I\&#39;ve become a frequent customer because the food is the best in the New River Valley I have not had a problem similar to what I experienced on that one occasion but I have had some incredible dishes I strongly recommend the salad sampler beef Wellington the lamp chops and the shrimp and grits In addition to the amazing food I have found the front of the house to give exemplary service A bad review now turns to an unqualified five stars This is a fantastic spot for lunch or dinner They have a diner side for families and a bar side for adults The Right Mind Brewery has their in house brews on tap Servers and staff on both sides were very welcoming and knowledgeable We came for lunch and loved our ahi kale salad and pimento grilled cheese sandwich We tried the brown ale the double IPA and the West Coast IPA We loved the brown and the double IPA the best We highly recommend Lefty\&#39;s and can\&#39;t wait to come back When visiting Blacksburg I wanted to eat at a local place versus the abundance of chain restaurants that pop up I selected Lefty\&#39;s based on several positive reviews and its proximity to where I was staying The food we ate was delicious and I believe locally sourced It came pretty quickly and was reasonably priced as well My problem with this place is the atmosphere It\&#39;s a mixture of boring and awkward The place is tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone\&#39;s house that I wasnt invited to The decor is outdated and the waiters seem to be having a conversation right on top of you (why are they holding lengthy conversations anyways?)I would be interested in trying their brunch outside if the weather was nicebut then again brunch on a busy street is not ideal This place doesn\&#39;t have a huge menu nor does it have the food items they used to have which are pictured here on yelp (the deciding factor to go) but what I had a cheese steak was good for the area and our son enjoyed a really good burger and fries Not too shabby Not winning any awards though The beer lines need a bit of work as our beers were slightly flat Our son said his Coke tasted like Pepsi I wouldn\&#39;t really go back by choice but wouldn\&#39;t turn down meeting people there if that was where they had already decided on going We had a nice meal at Lefty\&#39;s while visiting our son at Virginia Tech before the UNC-VT basketball game I chose Lefty\&#39;s because we were on a schedule and this restaurant was one of the few that took reservations Each of us (my husband son and I) ordered a different entree and loved our choices The meals were creative without being too weird and while we could have found less expensive choices (and certainly more expensive ones) I felt that given the portions and quality the meals were an excellent value In addition we had attentive service and were able to get in and out within a hour or so (my goal!) Food was very good but service was soooo slow 45 mins to get out the food on a non busy lunch day Server was non attentive Everything was just ok We ordered burgers and neither of us felt the need to finish them We also had the buffalo dip and we had one piece and were done I am in town for a reunion weekend and was really looking forward to having breakfast at Lefty\&#39;s We were extremely disappointed with the entire experience We waited over 20 minutes for them to bring out mimosas to the table and they hardly had any champagne The food was cold when it got to the table and the veggies were not cooked through it mixed in with the omelette Sausage gravy was cold and had some chorizo casings left inside When we told our waitress about the issues she asked me if she thought they should discount the check Love the burgers at Lefty\&#39;s Main St Amazing flavor juicy smoky Mine had pimento cheese melted all over could have eaten two Today was my first time going to Lefty\&#39;s after hearing the rave reviews from my friends I went with my boyfriend at 2:00 for lunch since we couldn\&#39;t make it for breakfast We started out with ordering the buffalo chicken dip as our appetizer which we were really excited about since it\&#39;s our favorite dip After hearing they were completely out of it we decided to try the calamari It came out extremely quick (less than 5 minutes) so we assumed it was just in a warming drawer which was kind of a turn off Most of them weren\&#39;t very crispy and just squishy (which I know is some people\&#39;s preference) but it was still good The portion size was small but it was worth the cheaper price (695) The house made marinara was really good along with the seasoning they chose For my meal I got the half asian noodle salad and half chicken club The salad was interesting I assumed the noodles would be cooked but it came with a teepee of hard noodles on top The sandwich seemed like it was just thrown together so it was really hard to bite into without everything falling out The atmosphere is cool and the service was great but I don\&#39;t think we would go back for lunch My friend and I came here because all of the other restaurants (its was a Saturday around 12) we wanted to go to had a long wait and Lefty\&#39;s didn\&#39;t have one at all We got the spinach artichoke dip as a starter and it was alright a lot more spinachy and not super creamy I got the pulled pork and Mac flat bread and my friend got the bacon cheeseburger The flatbread was overly sweet and very rich I only had a couple pieces and was already full and sick of it My friend said her burger was cooked decently and was juicy but had no flavor Her fries were pretty good though probably frozen to be honest Overall the food was a little below average hence the two stars Our server was nice and the food came in a timely manor but I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;ll be coming back to Lefty\&#39;s Very disappointing It takes forever to get a table Once you\&#39;re sitting your server never shows up I have to add that their sandwiches are not good I have tried 3 times to give a chance to this place but every time is the same Sandwiches without flavor soggy bread salads with literally 3 slices of protein(really hard to find the chicken or salmon in my plate) Sorry lefty\&#39;s but you can do better I was surprised I honestly thought that this place was fast food but I sure was wrong The food was great and portion sizes were perfect The food is pretty great highly recommend as a brunch place I had the eggplant sandwich--highly recommend Staff is friendly and eager to help It\&#39;s always been busy when I\&#39;m there too Locals and visitors alike seem to love Lefty\&#39;s! As a place to grab a bar meal this was better than most places i visited in Blacksburg The other appeal was that it was not filled with a bunch of chugging hipster college \&#39;bros\&#39; The sandwich was grilled properly and not overdressed The beer was cold and good The macaroni salad was interesting and slightly different All in all a decent time eating a solo dinner The staff was attentive and engaging The only complaint there was a cook with stained shirt and kitchen rag going behind the bar and filling a huge plastic cup with whatever he was drinking and chugging it down in front of customers Nobody wants to see that I fully understand they need to drink and stay hydrated but get a server to get them the drink and drink it in the kitchen or break area Be careful the waiter here can read minds lolFood was homemade and wonderfulExcellent soup and sandwichesHighly recommend this place that we stopped at will traveling through this neat cityWe had the chicken wrap and mushroom soup and coffee to drink Very good coffee!! I\&#39;ve eaten here twice I don\&#39;t eat red meat or pork so my options are VERY limited More so here than most places in town The first time was a shrimp posted boy Tasted like it had been under a heat lamp for to long It was very over done The second time was a Tuna salad sandwich which was fantasticThe service and atmosphere is nice however so here I am a third time enjoying my sunday here They really need more veggie options Especially a veggie burger I\&#39;d eat here much more often if they would just diversify their menu a bit for all dietary requirements I have not been in Blacksburg long I have drove by this place everyday and always thought about stopping by Today was that day Walking in with zero expectations I was totally blown away The food selection and menu size were both spot on I thought to myself how could I never of been here before?!?!?When the food came out I thought to myself why no bun I\&#39;ve never had a burger without a bun However I was not disappointed The bread was spot on and the burger patty itself was beautifully seasoned with an amazing char on it My fianc was a little thrown off by the size of the dish But after we ate we were both full(not stuffed) I\&#39;m guilty of pigging out when I go to a restaurant but I was actually really happy with the portion I had The main reason I didn\&#39;t give this 5 was just for little things My fianc burger was cooked a medium when she asked for medium well; I thought the goat cheese burger was amazing but I would of loved something to brighten it up a bit A lot of really rich flavors Also the stall in the men\&#39;s restroom is so high :D I felt like I was on my tippy toes Just silly issues reallyI had an amazing experience here and will be returning very soon! Just wasn\&#39;t all that Soggy onion rings mediocre cheesesteaks (could\&#39;ve done better ordering take out) The main plus was the jade ipa that we purchased and the fellowship with friends I just don\&#39;t think I would want to go here again We love Lefty\&#39;s for breakfast We\&#39;ve been fans since before they moved to their beautiful new location The food is good service fast and friendly and the atmosphere is relaxingThere is always something interesting on special but we usually go for a scramble or the Croque sandwich The Lefty Dog is a prefect pick me up after a late night We haven\&#39;t made it in for dinner yet but that\&#39;s definitely in the plans The service was great by Allison! And I\&#39;ve heard great things about lefty\&#39;s so I\&#39;m going to give it another try; but I wasn\&#39;t a huge fan Their salad is apparently amazingDefinitely trying again for their hyped Sunday brunch but was not pleased with my visit this afternoon What a charming place! Stopped in here for Mother\&#39;s Day lunch Surprisingly there was only a 20 minute wait Score! I had the Philly cheese steak with coleslaw and they were both delicious The cheese steak definitely hit the spot Husband ordered a BLT sandwich and the seafood bisque The sandwich was great but the bisque was very thin and had little seafood in it It was basically seafood flavored broth Little brother ordered a burger cooked medium-rare He told us that is seemed undercooked We thought he was being picky but felt the burger and it was still frozen in the center The server graciously sent it to be re-cooked and it came out better She nicely reminded us that he ordered it medium-rare and that next time he should order it cooked to a higher temp but we knew it had just been undercooked for medium-rare Instead of sending out a new burger they just re-cooked his which was a little disappointing There were some hits and misses but overall I would recommend this place Their menu looks fantastic and there are lots of things I would like to try! Always on the lookout for local brew pubs and when I \&#39;&#34;Yelped&#34; that this place came upwith decent reviews Dinner for 4 please! Pleasantly surprisedgreat choice of microbrews good food menu attentive service roomy inside and very good pub food (we didn\&#39;t try any of the entrees so can\&#39;t rate them) Perhaps petty but the only reason I didn\&#39;t give this place 5 stars is the inside atmosphere is a bit schizophrenic and the decor differs from room to room (I like my bar areas dark with heavy wood and their bar felt more like a diner) That said I\&#39;d come back in a heart beat Oh I don\&#39;t know Maybe I just don\&#39;t get it? I tolerated the old Lefty\&#39;s because they had kind staff and decent beer selection Mind you the food was never better than something you would get at a hospital cafeteria And now? Well I certainly don\&#39;t like the new Lefty\&#39;s now that there is a 40-45 minute wait for a zoo-like atmosphere with harried wait staff and small overpriced lumps of salt and grease comically served on huge plates We went for lunch today arriving before noon hoping to avoid a wait Wrong! We waited about 40 minutes for our food and when it arrived the Fries were cold and at first glance I thought that half my Bacon Cheeseburger was missing (it was so small) My wife\&#39;s ice (in her Coke) melted we waited so long I wondered at the time why the Cheeseburger was essentially naked and looking at the menu later I see that it was supposed to have lettuce tomato and onion on the side none of which came with my actual mealOn the plus side the waiter was friendly although it did get a bit annoying when he kept asking &#34;how\&#39;s it going?&#34; as we waited and waited for our foodOn top of everything else it was very loud We stopped in for a late lunch There was nothing on the menu that struck me as unique or particularly interesting It is all salads deli style sandwiches or burgers I had a turkey sandwich and it was no better than something I would make at home For two kids and two adults I spent $40 Steep prices for food that 100% mediocre If the food had been $20 we might go back again Service was pretty good We were seated quickly and the waiter was attentive Disclaimer: We didn\&#39;t order any beer Supposedly it is pretty good I got a very nice Mexican breakfast burrito that was tasty and well made While the tortilla itself was big enough they really skimped on the guacamole and black beans It was also exceptionally crowded with no waiting area in the restaurant And still they get 4 stars because it was a cute little place with good foodGood enough that I enjoyed my time there but maybe not good enough for me to go back Lefty\&#39;s has really blossomed in the new venue The food is still excellent but there are more choices The beer both in house (Right Mind) and guest taps is interesting and with something for everyone And the cocktails have been created by a master mixologist and are prepared with attention and art Not your normal college town bar Enjoyed our breakfast here today Waitress was great Food was good too Specialty cocktail was ok Nothing to write home about We enjoyed it and may be back but there are other places I\&#39;d like to try first My son had the croque monsieur and I had the pimento grilled cheese Both were good The coffee was top notch! I\&#39;m from California but find myself in Blacksburg from time to time as my significant other goes to school there I don\&#39;t usually find myself too impressed with restaurants in the Burg as California has spoiled me when it comes to quality food However I grabbed dinner at Lefty\&#39;s with the BF recently and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised! We dined in on a Saturday night and Lefty\&#39;s was buzzing with business When I asked the hostess how long the wait would be she told me that she could estimate that it would take about half an hour but it really depended on how fast people were clearing their tables I really appreciated her honesty as I feel that some hosts completely BS the wait time when asked We ended up being seated in about 15 minutes Awesome! I don\&#39;t remember our server\&#39;s name but he was a cool and polite dude He gave us just the right amount of attention - we felt taken care of but didn\&#39;t feel smothered Lefty\&#39;s has a great beer selection! It was one of the first things I noticed upon looking at their menu I ordered the classic cheeseburger with a side of onion rings and my boyfriend ordered the South of the Border burger with fries I enjoyed my burger a lot and the onion rings were perfect! (I\&#39;m really picky about onion rings too) I especially love how Lefty\&#39;s uses sourdough bread for the bun of their burgers I wish more restaurants did that! There were a few downsides though My boyfriend\&#39;s burger was cooked unevenly Half of his burger was medium rare and half of it was medium well I\&#39;m not really sure how they managed to do that but he enjoyed it nonetheless The fries were also lackluster and bland Overall I really enjoyed my dining experience at Lefty\&#39;s After the dinner I had there I\&#39;m dying to try their breakfast! I\&#39;ll definitely be back the next time I\&#39;m in Blacksburg Interior is nice but the biscuits and gravy dish is terrible It was kind of a spicy chili instead of a typical gravy looked like dog food Came here expecting to eat a solid meal in Blacksburg I ended up buying there most expensive entree they offered the rib eye steak When the plate arrived I was disappointed I wish I had bought the trip tip which looked much better when presented to other guests Be advised when dining here that the drinks are good but the food is so-so My boyfriend and I ate here for lunch and overall it was pretty good I got the spicy pimento grilled cheese and the TASTE was really good but it was not at all a grilled cheese It was just a sandwich with pimento cheese (and other toppings) on it My boyfriend got the pulled pork and mac n\&#39; cheese flatbread pizza It had a sweet sesame oil on it that kind of ruined it for me If it didn\&#39;t have that on it I would have LOVED it The prices are good service is great Love the atmosphere I\&#39;d go back &#34;Biscuits and Gravy&#34; is actually spicy chili on biscuits! Not what I expected or wanted I ate it anyway and the taste was fine for chili The receptionist was not the most pleasant person I\&#39;ve ever met but the waitress was fine Biggest complaints are: 1) $250 coffee Just plain coffee nothing special in ANY way; and 2) plates are ice cold I\&#39;ve never experienced this before Waitress said they are cold because they are stacked under an air vent and are always cold If I wanted salad a cold plate would be welcome but hot food became cold in seconds I would not recommend this place for breakfast UPDATE: Following the response from the restaurant I will try Lefty\&#39;s again; this time for lunch Need to hire someone to bus tables We waited for an hour and watched tables go uncleaned for 20 Minutes Asked server and she basically told us she was too busy Local chef with his own flair on everything they serve Something for everyone even vegetarians Burgers salads sandwiches and main meals like pork chops and steak Haven\&#39;t had anything I wouldn\&#39;t recommend here I go for lunchSmall selection of microbrew beer and wine available If weather is good can sit outside Did a return trip to Lefty\&#39;s on November 10 while visiting our VT student We had George as our sever and service this time was excellent and so was our appetizer and everyone\&#39;s meals for our party of five I stopped to eat at Lefty\&#39;s on 10/13 The restaurant has a great atmosphere the waitress that waited on me was great I ordered the Veggie quesadillas it was cut like a pie the first piece was great when I got to the second piece it was soaked through from the liquid of the tomatoes beans and corn It was so wet even the cheese had no taste I ended up pulling it apart and eating the vegetables Not worth another visit Breakfast rocks Genius chef re-invented southern biscuits into chorizo gravy biscuits get the southern and add side of home made salsa verde for the eggs and you have the best breakfast I\&#39;ve had in years!!! We also had the unusual but great tasting omelette with mango apple walnut And I grabbed a growler of their excellent house brewed Scottish ale to go If daughter picks VT I\&#39;m certain we\&#39;ll be here often! Unfortunately had a really poor experience with their service Called at 11:25 to make a brunch order and they told us that they stopped serving brunch at 11:30 and wouldn\&#39;t take our order Totally understand when a kitchen turns over but not taking our order before the time left us all wishing for a bit more hospitality(Update: appreciate the response by owners and explanation and will try this place again in the future) Great craft beer selection and awesome menu choices also even satisfied a vegan palate Went on a game day but got there early enough that our party of 6 was able to get served in plenty of time We did have a small wait ( less than 30 min) but we had planned for it I thought the selection of food was really good Ambiance was typical for a college town on a busy day I wouldn\&#39;t recommend if you were looking for a quiet or intimate setting But service was great Our server was Natalie and she was great Lefty\&#39;s never disappoints The breakfast is a unique menu with the jerk chicken omelette being a standout I always enjoy seeing what homemade bread will be offered and it\&#39;s always delicious Blacksburg seems to suffer from an &#34;uneven&#34; service epidemic THe service I had today was SLOW I didn\&#39;t come in at a peak hour or during a rush but it took a lot of time for my burger and onion rings to arrive almost an hour The portion size for was tiny small little burger with one little baby piece of bacon and like 5 onion ringsNOT worth the price they charge for this portion I want to like it but I can\&#39;t give a place with slow service and tiny portions anything but a 2 Let\&#39;s face it there aren\&#39;t many healthy options in Blackburg Most food revolves around bars chains and cheap unhealthy places student can afford Fortunately a few miles from downtown rests Lefty\&#39;s It was recommended to us by a server at one of those downtown bars and we\&#39;ll be back next time we\&#39;re in town Lefty\&#39;s has an excellent assortment of sandwiches salads and soups that blow away anything else in town if not the county All taste homemade fresh and don\&#39;t resemble anything you\&#39;d eat at a Panera Subway etc We came at the end of our trip and everything looked so good we wanted to start grabbing food off other people\&#39;s tables too! When in Blacksburg this is one of the better options and is affordable An added plus is excellent service which you won\&#39;t find anywhere downtown I\&#39;m going to go ahead and give this four stars because I have had really good experiences at other visits and it\&#39;s not fair to judge it based on this one bad experience I came in for a burger on April 1 It was busy but after giving me my water the waitress played on her phone not 10 feet away from me I waited only 35 minutes before deciding the service was not what I was looking for that day My food didn\&#39;t come out and I only got a refill on the water because the bartender took pity on me Great food great service Really cool old place We were there for lunch but I bet\&#39;s its a great place for after work or Friday night Lefty\&#39;s is our go-to place in Blacksburg Always excellent food good beer good service and a wonderful bar to sit and watch the game! We were in Blacksburg for the weekend for the football game and for my sister\&#39;s birthday so we took her out to lunch We came in to Lefty\&#39;s around 2 and they closed at 3 for the morning shift however we didn\&#39;t get our food until about 3 so we were unable to leave before they were closed (which we felt bad about) Lucas was our waiter and he was not personable and waited until everyone\&#39;s food was ready to inform us that they were out of their Jerk sauce so my mom had to change her order completely We are not typically high maintenance but the way he carried himself was very egotistical and nonchalant it was hard not to be Luckily the food made the experience worthwhile Severely disappointed with the service of my latest visit Lemons were put it every water when only 2 guests asked for lemon we waited 1 hour for our food to come out (and the restaurant was not crowded) the waitress was rude and uninterested and we received an inaccurate amount of change Overall I am extremely disappointed with the poor service we received from a restaurant that I have enjoyed in the past Great food really friendly wait staff And not to mention they brew there own beer on sight First time eating here have driven past on multiple occasions and never stopped I wish we had stopped before now Small portions iffy service flavorless food Places like this are what maintains Blacksburg\&#39;s local feel - lunch/dinner specials rotating beer taps a quirky but fun left-handed-centric decor and the owner comes in every weekend to cook breakfasts because that\&#39;s simply what he enjoys doing The owner a good aquantaince of mine says he will dream up crazy concoctions of food and pitch them to the chefs to try to pull off - this results in some amazing meals you won\&#39;t typically find on a menuThere are some true hidden gems on the menu if you like to get adventurous such as the cyclops (bacon pancake with an overeasy egg cooked into the center) and the potatoes pancakes are my two favorite breakfast items I had the best/most properly cooked duck of my life Only reason for a four and it pains me to say is that sometimes when its really busy the food isn\&#39;t quite as consistent as when you go at an off hour (for instance burger doneness) I think the same can be said at many restaurants however Been a number of years since my son and I went to Lefty\&#39;s for dinner But I want to thank Lefty\&#39;s for being the butt of our jokes ever since we went there while my son was in college We always get a laugh when one of us suggests we go back The service at that time was excruciatingly slow First it took forever to get a waitress to our table and then another long wait for our beers After sitting for what seemed like eons more our food finally came out I had salmon which was overcooked and tasted gamy  My son\&#39;s beef was not remarkable either We had a very difficult time getting the attention of our waitress even when our beer glasses were empty and it took forever to pay our bill I had a very long trip ahead of me returning to the DC area and was not in the mood for a long wait at an average-at-best restaurant Best burger in Blacksburg but can be very noisy Atmosphere so-so Interesting upscale menu choices We\&#39;ve been here twice and have been frustrated The first time we arrived at 1045 and they said they would not seat us for lunch until 11 Then we came back two weeks later at 11 and were told we couldn\&#39;t be seated until 1145 due to kitchen &#34;transitioning&#34; meaning that they wouldn\&#39;t seat anyone for 45 minutes Because of this a lot of people left or were turned away Also the drinks are located right in front of the entrance where people wait to be seated This makes it really crowded in the front and customers feel in the way At the same time the food is great and we\&#39;ll keep coming back This review is more for Lefty\&#39;s to read so they can fix these problems Outstanding meal The wasabi mashed potatoes were the &#34;Bomb-diggity &#34;! - a must do The roasted duck &amp; veggies were delicious The gluten-free chocolate cake was very tasty Always amazing I have to stop in here whenever in Blacksburg-area Leftys has the best brews and food around Me and my husband frequent this place We\&#39;ve never had a bad meal or a bad experience we just wish people wouldn\&#39;t love it as much as us sometimes because it\&#39;s packed when students are in town We love leftys!! This place was really really good I had the leftie burger which contained some kind of white cheese and red onions on sour dough bread OMG I wish i lived in North Carolina because I would literally eat here every day The place is surprisingly affordable at 8$ for a gourmet burger and fries They change up the desert menu frequently so get in there when they have something good LOVE this place One of my top favorite places to eat in the NRV LOVE the new location and every single thing I\&#39;ve eaten there!! Will keep coming back! Lefty\&#39;s is one of our Blacksburg favorites! The menu is always changing and it offers some truly unique and adventurous choices If you want a break from the usual dining options Lefty\&#39;s is sure to have something to please your palate Their shrimp and grits are my personal favorite I\&#39;m not quite sure what the hype is surrounding this place I tried their chili which was more of a bean soup with a tiny bit of meat (not spicy at all) and their salad was mediocre I could have made better at home I loved everything about this restaurant except for the service No one acknowledged us when we came in and we waited over an hour foe our food We split the leftys salad and the chicken club sandwich both were delicious We will definitely come back for the food and hope for better service Have been here for breakfast lunch and dinner and it never disappoints! Great food and great service Love the recent expansion of the restaurant too Def one of my favorites in Blacksburg Love Lefty\&#39;s!Great food and service often can be a bit crowded so I am excited they are moving into a larger space I\&#39;m being very generous for giving this place 3 starts because I do like the food a lot However the customer service is terrible The new inexperienced staff does not know how to serve the customers The food takes about an hour and a half to come out of the kitchen I understand this is a new location but this business has been in service for a while now so they need to step it up with their customer service Not a good restaurant if you\&#39;re trying to grab a quick bite Unique! I am never disappointed with Leftys It is a little frustrating when there\&#39;s an hour long wait and I really want leftys but that\&#39;s to be expected because it is such a small restaurant If you go on a game day weekend for lunch expect a crowd! They also stop serving breakfast pretty early but the lunch options are too good to pass up The restaurant is so cozy and the service is always so friendly! I\&#39;ve never had a problem here Now on to the food obviously the best part Make sure you check out the specials before you order off the menu They always sound delicious and unique! I can\&#39;t talk about one specific dish being my favorite because I try and order new dishes every time I come! My mom absolutely loves the Turkey Reuben (My parents ask to come to leftys every time they visit I\&#39;m never opposed to a free leftys trip) I\&#39;ve tried it and I understand why she loves it The burgers are awesome too they are served on a thin slice of bread rather than a bun which I love because it is the perfect amount of bread for the piece of meat I\&#39;ve gotten 2 of the salads as well The Cobb salad has the best dressing ever I was a little hesitant to order it at first because Cobb salads can be pretty plain but this dressing that came in it deserves some sort of award We also tried the nachos last time! The chips were perfect nachos chips that didn\&#39;t fall apart or get soggy However don\&#39;t get the &#34;super nachos&#34; if you\&#39;re not a huge fan of sweet chili Even if you\&#39;re a righty you should give it a chance And remember to check the blackboard for some specials We were looking for some good hot food this past chilly Saturday after a wedding After reading the Yelp reviews we decided to try Lefty\&#39;s since it wasn\&#39;t too far from our hotel We arrived near the tail-end of their dinner rush but it only took a few minutes to get seated Our waitress was cheerful helpful and patient as I struggled to pick my entree (too hungry) For our appetizers we ordered the calamari which was pretty good It wasn\&#39;t too deeply fried or heavily breaded but I think they could have been seasoned a little lighter We also got the homemade potato chips w/the lime &amp; cilantro dipping sauce After a few dunks of the sauce I thought it was \&#39;meh\&#39; and just ate the chips While I could see they were trying to offer &#34;out of the box&#34; dipping sauces my sauce was oil-based and didn\&#39;t add anything to the chip There\&#39;s a place in the Seattle area called The Ram and THEY know how to offer up hot homemade potato chips w/creamy garlicky dips!! I think my memory of those chips clouded my expectation of these chips Next time I\&#39;d just get the chips w/out a dip My hubby ordered the Founders Porter and loved it! Our entrees were pretty good He got the bacon cheeseburger and thought it was tasty and cooked according to his wishes I got the jumbo lump crab cake sandwich It was served on a lightly toasted brioche-type sliced bread w/avocado on the bottom bun Though I asked them to hold their chili-based sauce it came out with it so I scrapped it off Before deciding on the crab cake I asked my waitress if it had a lot of &#34;filler&#34; in it Of course she said \&#39;no\&#39; but I would say \&#39;yes\&#39; There wasn\&#39;t a lot of lump crabmeat in it but since it\&#39;s not like we\&#39;re eating next to the Chesapeake Bay I should have expected as much I ordered a bev that almost didn\&#39;t come but again our waitress was responsive apologetic and cheerful Our local friends tell us this is a great place for brunch and that unlike most restaurants their &#34;specials&#34; are truly that - special and made from fresh ingredients not leftovers Good to know Since my hubby enjoyed his porter so much we may go back next time we\&#39;re in town I\&#39;ll update my review then This is a cute southern / NOLA mock up of a restaurant in Blacksburg Had brunch here one Saturday morning when I was back in town for a wedding We started with the beignets which were more like breakfast hush puppies than the traditional NOLA beignet That\&#39;s ok they were delicious and served with syrup If you\&#39;re not in a rush I suggest trying these I continued with the bacon and apple omelet which did an excellent job of infusing crumbled blu cheese bacon sauteed apple slices into an omelet It came with home fries which were actually pretty bad but it could possibly be the outshine by the omelet that had me looking down on the side dish The sourdough toast tasted pretty good it sounded as if it was made fresh on site but maybe not Overall I would recommend this place if you\&#39;re in town and wanting brunch or breakfast We\&#39;ve been eating here for years; was disappointed with our service and and food quality tonight Brought home 2 burgers and on one the lettuce/tomato/onion was omitted The guacomole we ordered was brown and warm The slaw was warm And we only live half mile from the restaurant so the warm temperature of these foods did not occur on the way home Not worth $30 The restaurant was not busy at the time Really good food I had a BLT with pesto mayo and a red cabbage slaw The sandwich was naturally salty so I\&#39;m glad I didn\&#39;t go with fries My sister and her husband each had salads the Lefty and the Righty respectively My sister lives in Blacksburg and loves the place We sat outside which was a nice option but the patio is right on a fairly busy road near shopping areas I wouldn\&#39;t mind spending more time there and experience the beverage side of the operation but at least the service was good Arrived for lunch with some great reviews from friends Their lunch menu is apparently a little smaller than the dinner so if you want the full experience I may suggest waiting until dinnertime!As someone who LOVES sourdough bread over the bland boring white bread Lefty\&#39;s really hit the spot for me I ordered the Lefty\&#39;s burger which came out on sourdough over the conventional burger buns At first I was a little thrown off but as I took that first bite my worries all went away It was cooked exactly how I had ordered and tasted great with the perfect combination of veggies cheese and a juicy pattyI think the fact that it is a little farther than the rest of Main St\&#39;s food offerings is a little off-putting for people to want to consider going to Lefty\&#39;s for a meal but I encourage anyone that doesn\&#39;t mind taking a few extra minutes to drive away from the main downtown area to come take a seat here! Their food is definitely worth it and I am really glad that I got a chance to eat here before I graduated! Early dinner right when they opened for the evening hours is the perfect time to go since it is not busy and the servers are more attentive Fun decor and delicious specials! Highly recommend the Caribbean Pork Pasta and Smores cheesecake if they have it! Their Lefty\&#39;s salad is the bomb! And service is always great I\&#39;m vegetarian and there are several great options for me as well as others with dietary restrictions We came at 2:00 on a Friday for lunch so the crowdedness everyone talks about was not an issue Me and my husband visit my parents in Blacksburg and when we do we like to try new restaurants almost everyday as the food here is so incredibly cheap! My parents recommended this to us We had good service the hostess and our waitress However the food was nothing special Really basic basic diner food it was good- not bad in anyway at all just nothing amazing Blacksburg has some pretty good places so I probably won\&#39;t be back here- maybe to try the breakfast shrimp and grits because that\&#39;s supposed to be good- but I won\&#39;t come back for lunch or dinner just because I would rather go somewhere where I\&#39;m going to have something amazing This is not amazing just basic diner food On the up side- good service the place was clean and convenient location if you are staying near the downtown area of Blacksburg I was there to celebrate a special event with my husband but the place was too noisy for our taste We enjoyed the food and the service was friendly I have never had a bad meal here The food is reasonably priced and the service has been outstanding Best casual fare place in Blacksburg As good as it gets except I love love breakfast and was disappointed they stop serving at a certain point on a Sunday Otherwise I would have given 5 stars for personable service and food Fresh brewed iced tea is always important as well Sourdogh bread made a simple BLT amazing and the pesto a fabulous surprise Knowing I had my dog in the car (cool day outside and in shade) server gave me a piece of bacon to take to him Wonderful food and service!! Location is much improved over older one a block away Favorite brunch in Blacksburg Very busy on a Sunday morning - could use a better layout to take advantage of unused space in there as well as bring in more kitchen staff to provide quicker service Food was great Server was wonderful - very friendly and concerned about when we would get our food served Overall a great experience and we\&#39;ll be back! Lefty\&#39;s is out go-to weekend breakfast/brunch spotLunch time is great as well Salads with some meat usually do the trickFood is consistent and the different &#34;special&#34; bread selection is pretty coolStaff is courteous knows the menu and have always been accomodating and patient with our kidsThe coffee could be MUCH better but other than that we are very happy with Lefty\&#39;s andwill continue to be repeat customers you cant find a better place !!!!!!!! great food great staff and great atmosphere!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  A Blacksburg Original!!!!!!!!!!! I came in to Leftys on Saturday with some family to go to the Va Tech game We sat outside on the patio since it was so pretty First the hostess that greeted us had great smile and was very friendly Our server came out and introduced herself Her name was Jessica she took our drink order and was very prompt with getting them We even got some beers that they brew right there in house Since none of us had eaten there before we asked unfortunately lots of questions but instead of the usual of a college town we received a smile and wonderful answers from Jessica I got the Emerald Kale Salad that was recommended and might I say it was fantastic My only issue was it didn\&#39;t have enough dressing on it Which when I asked I received Everyone at the table loved their food and loved the recommendations given by our server At the end of our meal we asked how long she\&#39;d worked there and explained that she was new to Leftys and appreciated all of us being patient with her while she was still learning If she hasn\&#39;t told us she was new i would have thought she\&#39;d been there awhile Either they know how to hire new employees or train them well Good job all around and we will be returning and hopefully can get our wonderful server again &#34;this round and plump beef patty on toasted sandwich bread what the heck is oh wow that\&#39;s actually pretty good&#34; I wasn\&#39;t sure what to expect going to Lefty\&#39;s but I guess they have some unusual menu items that take interesting to delicious I REALLY REALLY wanted to try the Buffalo Chicken Omelette but they only served it for breakfast Too bad my time in Blacksburg has expired and I can\&#39;t give this place another shot :(Leftys gets most of their praise from me due to their impeccable cooking of my chili cheese burger The patty was just cooked perfectly and the chili was pretty good as well My friend ordered a bowl of chili and a salad and those looked pretty well executed as well They also have a decent selection of beers on tap I would have wanted to try the milk stout but was aching a bit much in the stomach to give it a shotI wasn\&#39;t too sure about putting my chili cheese burger on toast instead of bun but I guess it worked itself out in the end At the moment the the prices are just a bit too steep to warrant a four star review Lefty\&#39;s still is a solid place to get a sandwich and a brew Would give it a 3 at best It\&#39;s kind of expensive for lunch especially since they have a lunch menu I got the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and my boyfriend got the Jerk Chicken Philly Most of the items on the menu were $8-9 (which I find pretty expensive since I expect lunch prices to be around $6-7) It was kind of busy when we went but it shouldn\&#39;t have taken 30 minutes for our food to come out The food was okay/pretty good but I could find something better elsewhere for the same price that they charged Been to the new location twice in the last couple weeks Both times we were able to find a seat in the bar area right away The service was prompt and very friendly Their beer list is very good The in house brewery Right Mind Hop Yards beer features hops grown at Virginia Tech and is delicious Food both visits has been served promptly and tasted great The pimento grilled cheese sandwich is a favorite I had heard from a local that Lefty\&#39;s was super delicious and was sorely disappointed when I finally tried it out Pros and cons below:PROS:-Amazing server with a huge smile on her face who was very attentive-Great outdoor seating-Good menu selection-The homemade potato chips were goodCONS:-GREASY I was at a large table and tried a sampling of various appetizers and entrees and noticed that everything was drowning in oil I could not finish my sandwich because it was soaking wet from butter/oil (it was grilled chicken)-No real substitutions: I wanted to substitute one ingredient on my sandwich and was told that it would cost extra-Not a full bar (beer/wine only)-Corners have clearly been cut in an attempt to save money: off-brand condiments the &#34;pesto&#34; was pureed basil mixed with mayonnaise and horseradish thin/small napkins low quality flatware After coming to Blacksburg now for 3 plus yearsfinally a place that serves edible and creative food Plus a decent bar where you aren\&#39;t going to lose your hearing by simply sitting there for a pre dinner cocktailNot sure what the issues some of your reviewers had with Leftys but my wife son and I along with another couple and their son (frat brothers) ate their 3 straight meals and each was simply delicious Creative interesting and well presented Plus if your a beer afficando (which I\&#39;m notwill leave that up to our sonwho after 3 years at VT I begin to wonder if he\&#39;s majoring in beer and not business) then this might be the place as it\&#39;s also a &#34;micro-brewery&#34; on top of a above the curve restaurantHighly enjoyed our experience We\&#39;ll be back!! Thank goodness we discovered Lefty\&#39;s as I was beginning to believe education never left the campus grounds of VT after trying most of the popular eating establishments of the Blacksburg area Alas their IS Light in Blacksburg (Pun or no Pun intended) This was my go to placenot anymoreThe owner must have told employees to cut back on potions and food is always inconsistent prices are way too high at this place to keep having bad/smaller mealswill not be going back anymore!!!!VERY DISAPPOINTING !!!! New location and its impressive Good menu selection as well as beer and wine list We can\&#39;t wait to try the on site beer Rumor is they have a brewmaster from Parkway brewery and should have a great selection Not enough staff to handle Lunch crowd Food slow to come out Food is good though Stay away during lunch What a wonderful surprise this place was! My husband and I are new to the area and I was craving a steak We went to Lefty\&#39;s based on the other great reviews and arrived just before the dinner rush Our waitress was very nice and helpful I believe her name was Amy I got the Steak Au Poivre Let me tell you that was the BEST meal I think I\&#39;ve ever had! Seriously wonderful Do I recommend this place? Oh yeah!!! By far the best place to dine in Blacksburg Always unique specials a great regular menu and friendly faces I\&#39;ve never had a bad meal there and generally try something new each time! Definitely a Blacksburg treat! I\&#39;ve heard good things about Lefty\&#39;s but was always skeptical because of the mustard/red color scheme and the comic sans lookalike used as their banner fontA friend told me the menu was pretty eclectic for Blacksburg and after checking it out online I decided to give it a chance Unfortunately after a long night I was unable to make it for brunch but we were still made it for a lazy Sunday afternoonAfter perusing the menu I decided on the ham and asparagus sandwich which consisted of deli ham asparagus slivers and walnuts on a toasted hoagie roll with herbed goat cheese slathered on The combination of flavors created a nice balance - especially with the asparagus and ham I wish the goat cheese came out a little bit more Bold combination but I wish the goat cheese had more of an effectThe real winner that was ordered was the Lefty\&#39;s burger that my friend got The burger had a homey feel to it The chuck meat was rolled into a dense and thick patty that was seared to medium perfection Instead of a regular bun they used a hearty and crunchy sour dough bread On top of the patty was roasted red peppers and caramelized onions with the herbed goat cheese making another appearance The roasted red pepper and goat cheese complemented each other perfectly While the burger was slightly small it was definitely delicious If you\&#39;re looking for something different than your regular sandwiches and burgers for decent prices (all under $10) - come to Lefty\&#39;s! I\&#39;m definitely going to give this place another try I was pleasantly surprised after walking in it\&#39;s a hole in the wall! Probably my favorite restaurant in Blacksburg The burgers are awesome onion rings are fantastic and the salads are all amazing! Some of my favorite things on the menu have been the classic burger cashew chicken sandwich and the rightys salad (the homemade dressing is to die for) The service is always great very knowledgeable and prompt Never had a bad meal here They constantly change their specials to keep things fresh and seasonal Great atmosphere awesome food and not too expensive Wonderful staff keeps us coming back Super accommodating to dietary needs Everyone is friendly never had a bad experience Very nice restaurant I was here on business from out of town Noticed their old building so this must be a new location I had a burger which was outstanding as well as fries The fries were cold and stale so I sent them back But not to worry as I was promptly brought a large bowl full of fresh hot fries! Their beer selection is impressive My first experience here was horrible but hear me out That four stars is not a mistakeMy first experience I had bad service a way undercooked cheeseburger and no offer to fix the issue until the waitress overheard that I was going to write a scathing review on yelp about it all The waitress finally brought over the manager (who I had asked to see and had been refused) and my meal (which I did not eat) was compedOkay fine Let\&#39;s try them again a few weeks later Maybe my first time they were just having a bad nightAnd oh was I glad I went backThe specialty sandwich I had was delicious The sides were perfectly cooked and amazing Service was fantastic and I really enjoyed myselfI\&#39;ve returned several times since never seen the same waitress and always had a fantastic experience I\&#39;m pleased with Lefty\&#39;s and go there whenever I have the chance Lefty\&#39;s is where I go when I visit Blacksburg The menu always has just what I\&#39;m looking for I love the ham and asparagus sandwich but I try to break away and try other items when I\&#39;m in town Beers are great staff is friendly and they have great outdoor seating! I\&#39;ll be back soon! The food was fine but the service was lacking They use a system where your order with the kitchen is based in when you were seated but you don\&#39;t know that up front and they didn\&#39;t come back to us for 20 minutes after giving us water No checking for refills no taking our order no checking to see if we needed anything They were busy but not so swamped that they couldn\&#39;t have checked on us food is OK just too slow we wait for an hour when not so many people in store My food took so long to come out that I lost my appetite I think I waited 45 minutes forMy incredibly mediocre food to come out My waitress didn\&#39;t check on my table once to refill anything Good thing I don\&#39;t live in Blacksburg because I would not return This place rocks I\&#39;ve always had good meals here I take visitors here the outdoor seating is great service is always nice fun and friendly Just an all around good restaurant It\&#39;s easily my favorite place after having lived in the Burg for a few years now Spinach Bacon Burger Awesomeness!!!I\&#39;ve never had a bad meal here THIS is where I take guests when visiting from out of townThe food is excellent The staff is kind and helpful The wine and beer are very good as wellTHE BEST BURGER: The Spinach Bacon Burger - it is FAN-FRIKKIN-TASTIC!!! &#34;Ground chuck burger on grilled sourdough with sauted spinach bacon herb goat cheese and sauted onions&#34; Seriously this is my go-to meal when I\&#39;m there I\&#39;ve gone many times so I have tried other items on the menu but this one is my most favorite!Also you HAVE TO ORDER THE ONION RINGS!!! You WON\&#39;T regret it!!! Stopped by for the first time today I ordered South of the border burger with onion rings The burger was just okay the onion ring was the better of the two It was a bit pricey for the size I most likely will give it another try once they finish their new location I gave it 4 stars but it\&#39;s is about 3 1/2 stars at the best but I plan on giving it another shot Great breakfast! Our server Philip was awesome!!! I had the Croque sandwich It was amazing!!! I looked up brew pubs online and found this and 2 or 3 other local places I intended to go to a different place because it was close but when I found that it didn\&#39;t have any parking I decided to try Lefty\&#39;s  That was a lucky accident!  Their beers were outstanding and the food was equally good The atmosphere is nothing special but it\&#39;s not about the appearance it\&#39;s about the food and beer The chimichurri steak with risotto and lightly cooked root vegetables was as good as it gets The seasoning for the chimichurri was not a soupy sauce but nice freshly chopped spices The risotto and the vegetables were just as good The customers were students and locals and everyone was friendly enough to a stranger The Right Mind Brewing beers are made on-site and the Mandarina pale ale and the DIPA were crisp and perfectly hopped I sat at the bar so I can\&#39;t comment about table service but the bar service was great and the food was delivered promptly This is not an elegant place but the food I had was as good or better than what I\&#39;ve had at much more pretentious restaurants I\&#39;d give it another half star if the Yelp app had that option Lefty\&#39;s has become my new favorite You can never go wrong with their beer and salads Most specials are just simply divine Lefty\&#39;s salad is my fav but there are just many things on their menu to enjoy As far as local goes this is a must try for any passer by and should be a regular for any local This place is one of our girls night favorite spots! I always get one of their burger on a sourdough bread with the lefty\&#39;s salad staff are very friendly too Stopped in for an early Sunday breakfast Service was quick and the bloody marys were great Bacon pancake was everything a fan of the pig could ask for! Just had lunch here Heard they had the best Cobb salad around Have to say not impressed Microscopic bits of blue cheese and specks of egg No guacamole or bacon to be found Salad dressing good Good IPA though Server took a discount on the salad since it didn\&#39;t live up to expectations Will give them another try when in town again Lefty\&#39;s is a go to place for our family nearly every weekend This morning was no exception and the brunch special was delicious Eggs Benedict on sourdough with Salmon bacon and avocado!! The service is always great and the food is always amazing Can\&#39;t wait for next weekend!! We brought some friends from out of town here and everyone loved their meal! The service was great as well! Had the biscuit and chorizo gravy delicious and paired well with the Mama Mack wheat Homebrew Definitely coming back Food and drinks were great! Our server Allyson was wonderful!! She was very attentive funny and gave great appetizer suggestions (the calamari was soooo good)We really appreciated that she got our groups food to us so quickly and made sure we didn\&#39;t lack for anything The prices were completely reasonable and we will go back again the next time we\&#39;re in town Doug M of Lefty\&#39;s Main Street Grille Thank you for your response Personal preference for how we want our food prepared is not outside of reason My husband is allergic to mushrooms and does not eat them The mushroom and special sauce for the potato pancake would not have salvaged it It was not what we expected Potato pancakes mean different things to different people like what is a fried egg You are correct in that we should have reported it to the server A fried egg is a fried egg in the future at other establishments we will purposely ask what is meant by a fried egg You criticized our &#34;personal preference&#34; for a meal we paid for and left the server a tip? Enjoy your new location because you have assured that we will never step foot inside itLooking for a nonchain to patronize Really done with this place this time 1 Filth and disgusting grime made our stomachs turn before our food came The place was packed which would lead me to believe they do a good business Hire a professional cleaning contractor to clean this dump up The floor and the kitchen area are in really bad shape The bathrooms are pitiful The staff obviously either can\&#39;t do it or just don\&#39;t care 2 The food Potato pancake was a strange gelatinous mess No flavor and just a mess Hubs covered it with napkin No hope Fried egg bacon cheddar sandwich with pesto mayo Get mayo on side That concoction is not good The &#34;fried&#34; egg is really fried white only My child found out when a big runny yolk squished into her lap I never serve my child raw eggs We would not have ordered it if the menu indicated uncooked yolk That ruined the sandwich from then on Even after cutting that part out the cheddar was bland and bacon not good The side of potatoes and chocolate milk were the only saving graces of our meals $3800 (with 2 drinks and a water) for 3 plates of barely edible food we left most of on the plate This brunch outing was a fail This was once a regular lunch spot for myself and friends The food was always good and the staff was helpful The waiters were also honest; they didn\&#39;t just recommend the priciest menu items The menu items were very creative especially the soups Unfortunately a few things makes it very difficult for me to justify returning This place is quite dirty From sticky menus to sticky seats and tables Additionally there were remnants of meals left in many nooks and crannies The chef is in a very visible location in the restaurant While preparing food I feel hygiene is very important Personally seeing the chef scratch his head touch his face and then bare-handedly prepare my sandwich was too much of a put offIf dirt grime and germs aren\&#39;t a problem to you then I\&#39;d recommend the good food Great little place Highly recommend the jalapeo bottle caps grilled chicken sandwich and philly cheese steak I would go back again Kid friendly also I\&#39;m not a huge sandwich fan but I come here often as they have decent beer and wine Sandwiches are very good; I\&#39;ve tried many and I find they do a great job making them tasty and interesting Sides are not as impressive but the red potato salad is good with Tabasco sauce All in all a decent spot for lunch I have been eating salads here lately and they are excellent Oh Lefty\&#39;s I\&#39;m so glad you exist Whenever we\&#39;re not sure where we want to eat we always just end up choosing you because it\&#39;s always great The service is cheerful if often inattentive But the food is consistently delicious and frequently creative It\&#39;s nice to not have to battle downtown parking and the outdoor seating is a bonus I just wish you were bigger (twss) And I\&#39;m kicking myself for not being able to discern the common element to the photos on the wall without asking Really great sandwich selection! I\&#39;ve had their Lefty\&#39;s burger and a special they had one day - a chorizo and sweet potato panini It was so delicious even though I knew it was so bad for me! The jalapeno poppers were good too I remember them having a unique dessert selection as well but wasn\&#39;t able to try any Great for lunch! My parents and I ate here tonight for the first time and we loved it I had the Cobb salad and I was not disappointed The three of us also shared a slice of cheesecake which was absolutely delicious We had our dinner on the inside of the restaurant and enjoyed the decor The specials were displayed on a gigantic chalkboard which was unique The restaurant also had a lot of pictures on the wall of famous people and cartoons which sparked conversation between our family Lastly the waiter we had was super friendly and patientPs Please forgive any grammar mistakes We came here for lunch last weekend and we weren\&#39;t too impressed I feel like their menu has been condensed a bit? It could just be a foggy memory on my part but my fiance pointed out that back then there used to be more items and now it\&#39;s basically just Sandwiches and burgersThe service here was great - our waitress was attentive and quick to offer refills but the food just came out painfully slow We came on a Saturday and it was a little more crowded than usual but 2 sandwiches shouldn\&#39;t have taken that long to makeMy fiance got the Chicken cashew sandwich and said that the chicken was not marinated at all It was just a piece of plain chicken that was grilled The only flavor on the sandwich was the sauce they put on it and even that couldn\&#39;t save the sandwich from being utterly blandI got a turkey sandwich with bacon and goat cheese It may have been their turkey club The goat cheese was very flavorful but I was a little disappointed that they used turkey deli meat I thought I was going to get actual carved turkey breast The deli meat was too salty for my taste I just didn\&#39;t think it was that good I probably wouldn\&#39;t come back here again You can spend less and get more flavorful foods elsewhere I think that this place has definitely declined over time It used to be really good but lately it just hasn\&#39;t been the same haven\&#39;t been there in several years but it was a great place What can you do with the ambiance when you are stuck with the shell of a long john silvers but they make up for it with their food good luck folks Hope to come back to sample it This is my first time back since I graduated and I just want to say how great the new place is The food is still incredible (pimento cheeseburgerhello!) but the staff is what really makes this place Our bartender Hayley was absolutely out of this world She made several awesome beer recommendations and even let me try the blueberry bread from breakfast when I mentioned how I like blueberries 11/10 would recommend Huge selection! Great vegetarian and gluten free options I had a bowl of soup with bread for $5!!! They also have great servers that make fabulous recommendations Dessert was worth the splurge too Meh- this is a review of the NEW Leftys - so rather than Long John Silvers this is a poorly re-worked Asian pagoda restaurant So for the big opening people were waiting on old torn chairs Nothing new in the menu - food came lukewarm  Much ado about nothing I honestly think this decor is worse than the old restaurant- at least you didn\&#39;t expect much at the old place Get some new items on the menu ! Won\&#39;t take long before people realize they have been duped! I was really hoping this would be awesome  Same level of disappointment as Mellow Mushroom- should be awesome but something always sucks Went there on 3/27/15 the place was packed It\&#39;s a sandwich shop that is trying to become a bistro but there\&#39;s ketchup and mustard on the table Food is good not great good craft beer selection on tap Bread bun was old and hard The reason I am giving them only 2 stars was the filthy and disgusting bathroom It looked worse than an interstate gas station bathroom It didn\&#39;t stink but the floor had not been cleaned in a LONG time and the toilet had crud built up on it NASTY They are moving to a new location soon maybe they can hire someone to keep that place clean We were one of the only couples here early on a Saturday afternoon I always get anxious when a place isn\&#39;t crowded during a normal meal time My fears were quickly assuaged My burger was perfect and the blackberry cheese cake we had for dessert was sinfully good I regret but coming here before graduation Incredible sandwich on their nice porch started the day off right Highly recommended The Sunday brunch is a must I\&#39;ve never had anything I didn\&#39;t like The French toast and pancakes are amazing! Man this place is good!! Literally just got done eating the Spinach and bacon burger which had a very mild herbed goat-cheese and some caramelized onions on it It\&#39;s also served on some crusty toasted sourdough bread That was a seriously good burger!! The boyfriend had what I guess was their special burger of the day which was the Chipotle BBQ Pork burger and although I\&#39;m not a fan of blue-cheese I took a bite anyway and it was super-delicious!!! We also decided to be fat kids and got dessert I got their Cranberry-Walnut chocolate chip pie and OH MY GOD!!!! You realllllly need to try that Randy got the Bourbon Pecan Pie which was good buuuuuut mine was better They make their own desserts and I really hope they make their pie crusts too because it was amazingly buttery flaky and delicious If they don\&#39;t make their crusts I don\&#39;t want to know Just let me keep thinking they doWhile we were ordering our food (to go) we looked over their extensive beer and wine lists (but mostly the beer) and they have a great selection! Lagunita\&#39;s Bell\&#39;s and other craft beers! The service was good too I have to add! (Mostly because I\&#39;m a server)The only reason I didn\&#39;t give it 5 stars is because all the toppings of the burger were on the bottom and I felt that it made the foundation (bun/bread etc) kind of soggy But definitely give this place a go!!! I highly recommend it!! I am so excited to have found this place! It is an unexpected gem in Blacksburg that makes use of quality ingredients and some creativity in its kitchen My friend and I visited for an early dinner on a Saturday night Unfortunately for us they were out of the duck confit salad so we\&#39;ll have to go back! We split the blue cheese bruschetta which was a sizable portion and perfect for two perhaps three people The sourdough was crisp the tomatoes were juicy the cheese was stinky and flavorful; what more could you ask for in an appetizer? We then split the mahi-mahi dish with risotto cake and green beans We were pleasantly surprised when the waitress arrived at our table with two equal halved portions of fish risotto green beans etc Honestly considering how generous they were with our &#34;half&#34; portions I\&#39;d be hesitant to order a full order for myself The fish was spiced well the green beans were perfectly cooked and the risotto cake was creamy spicy and delicious I can\&#39;t wait to go back and try some other dishes from their menu Service was a bit over-eager however I think we were out waitress\&#39;s only table and I\&#39;d prefer prompt service over neglectful service so I suppose I should not complain YAY Lefty\&#39;s My fianc and I came here for a late breakfast on a Saturday because we read some solid reviews on yelpWe weren\&#39;t disappointed! The service was friendly large portions and the sun was out and we enjoyed the deck out frontParking was on a private lot and ample Very relaxed atmosphere and affordable pricesOne small note - the eggs seemed have chili of some sort and had a little bit of a kick Amazing food as always We absolutely love the new location! Staff is always very personable and wonderful to talk to Way to go guys on a successful first week! We love to eat here for lunch - the food is reasonably priced and the staff is always friendly They have an outdoor patio with umbrellas where we enjoy sitting and eating on pretty days I enjoy dining there only if we can sit on the patio - the inside is a little dark and has a pub feel to it Good sandwiches and salads We came on a Sunday for breakfast and we weren\&#39;t impressed First of all everything was sticky (the table the highchair and the booster seat) so we were kind of grossed out before we even started eating We ended up getting some beignets an omelette and regular scrambled eggs The beignets were under cooked (the center was all doughy) The potatoes that came with our meals were also under cooked Probably not trying this place again Hands down my favorite all-around restaurant in the NRV Prices are very affordable for the quality of food I always watch the daily specials which never disappoint Brunch is awesome - I\&#39;m pretty sure there\&#39;s nowhere else in the NRV to get fresh beignets The burgers are good but not traditional so don\&#39;t expect what you would get from a typical burger joint In three years I\&#39;ve never had bad service Great sandwiches fresh and healthy options I love the grilled eggplant sandwich and Lefty\&#39;s salad The burgers are usually good as well as the sandwiches and salads I try to eat here for lunch if I can The service is mixed sometimes good sometimes bad so you never are guaranteed good service but at least you will get some fair food regarding the burgers sandwiches and salads I absolutely love this place and visit every time I am back in town I\&#39;ve had a variety of the sandwiches and burgers and everything is always delicious They have a wide variety of sides and the homemade potato crisps as an app are the bomb! The soups I have tried are homemade and yummy The Lefty\&#39;s salad is one of my faves They have great combos where you can get a half or whole sandwich with a soup or salad if you don\&#39;t want one of the other sides The staff are always friendly as is the owner I have never had dinner here unfortunately but I\&#39;m sure it is good as well One of my favorite places in Blacksburg although I usually only get the specials written on the blackboard I had the 16 oz ribeye medium rare with gorgonzola cheese and I loved it! I\&#39;d rate their steaks up there with Blackstone Grill down in Christiansburg but it\&#39;s about $10 less (although atmosphere is better at Blackstone) Their salads are also very creative with their dressings paving the way Th service is also very good in general Sometimes you get a rookie or two who forgets that you even exist so that can be frustrating at times but I\&#39;ve never encountered a bad attitude which is what I hate the mostPrices are pretty reasonable Their burgers and sandwhiches are in the $8-12 range and come with fries The steak I believe was around $25 and the pasta around $15 A bit more expensive for the good stuff but well worth itDefinitely a gem in Blacksburg! I\&#39;ve only been to Lefty\&#39;s for breakfast but I\&#39;ve never been disappointed They have a very unique selection and the special is always new This has become my parents\&#39; favorite place in Blacksburg so we usually go whenever I\&#39;m in town I most recently had the Cyclops pancake The syrup whatever it has in it is delicious My first meal in Blacksburg Never been disappointed Good sandwiches good dinners Casual dining and a decent price range Very cool place The food is about on par with Macado\&#39;s; mostly burgers and sandwiches with an amazing selection considering the tiny size of the place Full bar with a nice selection of beers and wines I\&#39;ll definitely be back! The breakfast and brunch is wonderful!! Love the homemade breads The portions are great and so are the prices Even basic dishes taste great This is the best place we found in Blacksburg for different types of sandwiches salads good burgers and some unique items that change periodically More like a California type of place using local ingredients but with a very different twist Also excellent unsweet iced teaI am told the breakfast/brunch is excellent and very crowded since serving time is limited to the weekend  One time we came the service was very poor even thou the food was good; the next time the service was excellent Lefty\&#39;s used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Blacksburg Now it\&#39;s on my worst restaurants in Blacksburg list Each time is more disappointing I had a BLT with shredded lettuce a not ripe tomato and 2 slices of low quality bacon How do you mess up a BLT? There are only 3 ingredients! I had a chicken dish for dinner one night Flavorless and overpriced They got rid of the only good item on their menu The curry chicken salad sandwich Now they have a new wrap form of that item which is not nearly as good Pretty bad actually Bottom line: I\&#39;m not going back to Lefty\&#39;s Had an early dinner there one night and I won\&#39;t be going back Pricey for the food delivered It just wasn\&#39;t anything special Nothing special by far No flavor Blah I think this place gets overlooked sometimes because of it\&#39;s location which is a shame The food here is quite good The roasted eggplant sandwich and Lefty\&#39;s burger (topped with goat cheese grilled onion and roasted red peppers) are two of my favorites The chips are homemade and always delicious as are the onion rings I\&#39;ve been here a couple of times for breakfast and it\&#39;s been enjoyable They serve pretty standard fare: eggs french toast etc It\&#39;s a nice alternative to Gillie\&#39;s if you\&#39;re trying to avoid crowds and/or are craving bacon! They also have a great patio outside! nice cozy breakfast place recently visited Leftys for breakfast with some local recommendations they have a good breakfast menu even accommodating vegetarians our breakfast was served hot and with little waiting time our waitress was great and was frequently checking on coffee the breakfast was so heavy we ended up not eating lunch that day well worth the money Second time in two week first time the burgher had cheese I don\&#39;t like cheese today the the burgher was burned mentioned to the waiter both time she said I will mentioned to the kitchen I left nice tip and walk out both time I\&#39;m pretty sure this place used to be a Long John SIlver\&#39;s at least that\&#39;s what it looks like on the outside This is deceiving though because the food is really tasty I ordered the salad and sandwich and salad combo for only $10 and got a whole sandwich and a choice of any salad not just a house salad I got the main street salad Pretty standard but didn\&#39;t need much dressing which is always a plus I also got the ham asparagus sandwich and it was really good It sounds like an odd combo but the walnuts added a perfect crunch also Great little place for the money One of my friends got the homemade chips as a side and I had a couple (or more than a couple) and they were really good as well I like that most of the sandwiches come on sourdough or rye really yummy bread choices Much more than a standard burger place Fresh takes on standard fare at reasonable prices as well as an excellent draft beer selection The service is typical for a college town and has always been average or better Don\&#39;t let the looks deceive you- try it! Lefty\&#39;s makes the best burgers in town hands down They are always juicy original (who else makes a burger on sourdough toast with goat cheese roasted red peppers and onions?) and inexpensive; and usually fast We went for breakfast once and really enjoyed it I\&#39;m not sure I\&#39;d agree with the other review that it\&#39;s better then Gillies but its definitely in the top two in Blacksburg Excellent breakfast place with great service! The dinner menu also looked impressive with some unique options The locals seem to like Lefty\&#39;s a lot and were very friendly Lefty\&#39;s serves breakfast on Saturdays and Sundays and lunch and dinner Tues-Saturday They are very popular for their burgers salads and sandwiches but also have daily dinner specials that are quite good (and large!) Their pork bbq sandwich is amazing! And I love that they always have homemade soup and dessert specials The atmosphere at Lefty\&#39;s does not reflect the quality and care which they put into their food however There is outdoor seating but I hope they realize there should be an umbrella at every table because the sun can be very bothersome while eating and conversing Despite the Buzz - TOTALLY DISAPPOINTINGWent on a Saturday for a late lunch (before 2:00 pm) not too long ago Typical wait for the table (20 mins) but then 15 mins to even get acknowledged by a server - took drink order (sodas) 10 minutes to get a coke and a diet coke Ten minutes later time for our order Waited almost 20 minutes to get the food and was informed that they were out of french fries (common - this is a burger and sandwich joint) Burgers were overdone and bone dry Will not be doing any time at Lefty\&#39;s until the get it right I\&#39;ve always heard good things about this place My advice is to definitely avoid it on game weekends We sat and waited about 15 minutes for menus before our order was taken The next 45 minutes was filled with a series of visits from our friendly waitress informing us of the things they ran out of: oj? Potatoes French toast! This is not a server issue It\&#39;s a sign of poor management The server issue came when 5 of the 6 of our orders came out wrong and short items We then waited for silverware to eat with The cherry on top was a manager who made excuses instead of apologies Lefty\&#39;s is easily passed by It wasn\&#39;t until recently that I started to revisit them I had forgotten how good the food is Nothing on the menu really stands out but it\&#39;s more interesting then your average burger joint They\&#39;ve got a pretty good breakfast too it\&#39;s worth getting up early for on the weekends anyway The wait staff is typical of Blacksburg On my last visit I ordered one thing and received another I didn\&#39;t raise a fuss the food was good anyway and I got to try something I normally wouldn\&#39;t have ordered Amazing food Great beer Good service I have been here several times for breakfast lunch and dinner since moving to Blacksburg last October I have never been disappointed I never expected to find such great flavor profiles and delicious micro brews in SW Virginia Keep up the good work Lefty\&#39;s Note to aesthetic sticklers: this is not the best place for a charming dining atmosphere unless you consider a renovated Long John Silver\&#39;s restaurant charming But give Lefty\&#39;s a shot--it is definitely worth it They\&#39;ve done about the most they could possibly do with the space (the order counter turned into the server stand) But Lefty\&#39;s is really about the food They have a great lunch menu complete with a delicious Turkey Ruben (mmm sauerkraut) with the best fries in Blacksburg Another favorite is the Pork Mango sandwich If you\&#39;re feeling really brave get the hot dogs and couscous While you\&#39;re at it enjoy a pint from their decent draught selection I promise this place doesn\&#39;t smell like stale hush puppies anymore Make it a point to stop by but they\&#39;re closed on MondaysPS Breakfast is great too--probably the best in Blacksburg! I have been a regular at Lefty\&#39;s since 2004 and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food While breakfast used to be served daily it is worth getting up early on the weekends to avoid the inevitable wait (because the food really is THAT good) Their omlettes remain to be my favorite in Blacksburg (and Virginia for that matter) and their homemade breads are a must Honestly you haven\&#39;t had zucchini bread until you\&#39;ve had it at Lefty\&#39;s The lunch and dinner menus are the same but still quite delectable While most are items on the menu are classic favorites (sandwiches burgers salads) there are twists to most that give them real character  Additionally they have daily dinner specials (often a pasta dish) that are sure to get your appetite\&#39;s attention Service was very good Calamari was very good rib eye was better then normal My wife loved her hamburger Better then the average My wife and I love Lefty\&#39;s We\&#39;ve been there several times and the food is always good They also have the best burgers around The salad dressings are homemade and and the lime cilantro is my wife\&#39;s favoriite They have a nice selection of wines and beer Our only suggestion is to insulate the walls and windows because during the cold weather the restaurant temperature drops making it uncomfortable Went here for breakfast on 10/9/2011 after visiting tech for the weekend Lots of people waiting so we thought it would be good Once we got seated we ordered the homemade donuts whch were a big let down -- no flavor just fried dough balls--- then we waited and waited and waited for our order--- we noticed when we were seated that alot of other people were waiting for food too which is never a good sign Once we finally got our order we had to ask silverware and napkins and one of the omelets was all wrong and had to be sent back Absolutely nothing special and a 2 hour ordeal for breakfast on a SUn morning is not worth it We can appreciate it was a busy game weekend but please-- that is not uncommon for this town and the management needs to adjust accordingly Poor management poor service and ok food-- this is off our list for the future visits!! I know many people enjoy this place for their burgers and sandwiches which I agree are quite tasty But I\&#39;m a huge fan of breakfast at Lefty\&#39;s Seriously it\&#39;s one of the best places for a morning meal especially if you would like some bacon with your meal They have nice selection with some fun varieties to the standard omelet and french toast Plus I really like the service here Best burgers in town! Highly recommend the Spinach Bacon and Lefty\&#39;s burgers The service can be hit or miss but that is typical in Blacksburg unfortunately I\&#39;m a fan of eating outside on a beautiful day Their dinner menu is better than their lunch menu in my opinion but I can always find something I like Portions aren\&#39;t huge and ingredients are fresh Not the best atmosphere inside feels like a cafeteria but outside is nice Also props to the establishment for its &#34;lefties at lefty\&#39;s&#34; night where are the liberals can get together and not feel like they\&#39;ll be pounced upon by a popped collar frat boy who likes BUSH I like Lefty\&#39;s for it\&#39;s different selection of sandwiches and burgers They\&#39;ve got great beers available (although never a beer special) and a really nice patio area Last time I was there I had a Stone IPA with their &#34;apple bacon bleu&#34; sandwich and sat outside  Loved every bit of it i\&#39;m glad we gave lefty\&#39;s another shot after a couple experiences with bad service the food is reliably good and the specials are always great the have some of the best brunch food in blacksburg and their dinners are great i love blacksburger beer and am thrilled they have it on tap the atmosphere iswella renovated Long John Silvers Don\&#39;t expect a quaint charming atmosphere but the foodthe food will make you smile! Went for the first time last week My Lefty burger was fantastic The soup was ok at best and my friends salad/sandwich was ok I was happy friend wasn\&#39;t&#39;</pre>

<p>Reviewers are most likely motivated to post a review by negative experiences. The outliers of text length seem to be positive by analyzing PN Differences alone. However, actual star data shows that besides a single long positive review, most long reviews are neutral at best.</p>
<p>The current iteration of the PN Difference serves as a horrible predictive variable. It can't even predict base star ratings correctly due to the massive amount of positive reviews with negative PN-Ds and negative reviews with immensely positive PN-Ds. Until improvements in sentiment analysis are made, the Star ratings will be the most reliable form of positive/negative data.</p>
<p>One fact we know for sure that this analysis revealed is that Blacksburg Yelp customers thought that negative reviews were the more helpful ones .My first assumption is that once restaurants cross a "good enough" threshold, consumers stop caring. If they find an impressively scathing review, they may think "wow, dodged a bullet this time," and rate it as useful as thanks for the heads-up.</p>
<p>If I wanted to continue my analysis, I would continue the analysis of the Useful metric and Star ratings with Yelp review  data from other cities, such as my hometown of Richmond (a hidden foodie destination).</p>
